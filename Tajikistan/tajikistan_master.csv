57839,"Chinese Government grants $764,526 of humanitarian aids for natural disaster relief in Tajikistan","In 2011, Chinese Government granted $764,526 USD to Tajikistan in the form of humanitarian aid for flooding and other natural disasters, according to the May 2018 Flat Export of the Tajikistan AIMS, 'Humanitarian aid for flood and other disasters', AIMS project ID is TJK/112260. Though the Flat Export does not tie this project to a specific disaster, it is possible that the referenced flooding was a series of June 2011 floods and mudslides in Sughd Province (see 'Tajikistan: Floods and Mudslides - Jun 2011'). STAFF_NOTE: This project should not be confused with project ID#40441, the 2012 natural disaster response from China to Tajikistan.

46215,China Eximbank provides $8.36 million government concessional loan for Safe City Project (Linked to Project ID#71411),"On May 20, 2013, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed two loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Safe City Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20-year maturity, 11-year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest, 20-year maturity, 9-year grace period).

The precise face value of the GCL loan and the precise face value of the PBC loan are unknown. However, it is known that the GCL and PBC are jointly worth $20.9 million USD, and that 40% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($8.36 million) came from the RMB-denominated GCL and 60% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($12.54 million) came from the USD-denominated PBC (AidData learned this through correspondence with the IMF, see ""Following Up"" resource). Project ID#46215 records the GCL and project ID#71411 records the PBC. 

The loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament in June 2013 and were expected to be repaid with revenues from the traffic fines generated by this project. The total cost of the project was $22 million USD. In addition to the Chinese loans, the Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.1 million USD.

According to Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Safe City Project involved the installation of 855 CCTV cameras for round-the-clock monitoring of traffic and other movements at 75 crossroads, streets, and squares in the capital city of Dushanbe. The cameras were to record every offense committed by drivers, which would be stored and processed in a common database. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was responsible for project implementation. Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs was also responsible for the undertaking of the project. 

The Safe City project and the control center were officially launched on October 31, 2013 by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. The Safe City Project was to be carried out in three stages; the second stage was expected to be finished in May 2014. The project was still on going as of December 2014. As of January 16, 2015, it had reportedly generated $4 million for the Tajik state budget via traffic fines. According to a Huawei report issued in February 2015, Huawei completed the project successfully. 

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Автоматическая система управления транспорта в городе Душанбе (Безопасный город). Asia Plus reported at the time that Tajikistan authorities claimed the loan would be repayable through traffic violation fines.

46222,"China Eximbank provides $118 million USD loan for 15,000 Hectares Agricultural Industrial Park Project and 200,000 Spindle Textile Project (Linked to Project ID#54353, #71757)","In June 2016 , at the 2016 Silk Road Financial Forum in Warsaw, Poland, the Xinjiang Branch of the Export-Import Bank of China signed a framework agreement with Xinjiang Zhongtai (Group) Co., Ltd for the 15,000 Hectares Agricultural Industrial Park Project and 200,000 Spindle Textile Project. Then, a commissioning ceremony for the project took place on August 31, 2016. China Eximbank provided a $118.343 million loan in 2016 to Zhongtai (Dangara) New Silk Road Textile Industry Company for the 15,000 Hectares Agricultural Industrial Park Project and 200,000 Spindle Textile Project. 

Zhongtai (Dangara) New Silk Road Textile Industry Company is the company responsible for project implementation. Zhongtai (Dangara) New Silk Road Textile Industry Co., Ltd. was founded in the Dangara District of Tajikistan's Khatlon Province in 2014 by China's Xinjiang Zhongtai Group and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps. The Zhongtai Dangara Agriculture and Textile Industrial Park project consisted of an agricultural park with 15,000 hectares for growing cotton; a spinning plant with 110,000 spindles and manufacturing facilities for weaving, printing and garment. The groundbreaking ceremony of the entire Agricultural and Textile Project was held on December 19, 2014 (""中泰新丝路塔吉克斯坦农业纺织产业园奠基""). The second phase, including the start of the airflow of 50,000 spindles, was to be completed in 2017 (see ""塔吉克斯坦总理科希尔·拉苏尔佐达一行考察中泰集团公司""). The launch ceremony of the second phase of the air spindles was held, and the third phase held its groundbreaking ceremony on November 5, 2018. The third and fourth phases started on March 18, 2019.

The Agricultural and Textile Industrial Park project was reportedly the largest agricultural and textile investment project in Tajikistan since its independence in 1991. The project included 200,000 mu of cotton agricultural park and 150,000 spinning spindles. The first phase of 150,000 mu of cotton was to be sown in 2015, and the spinning project was to be completed and put into operation on August 31, 2016. After the project is completed, the industrial park was expected to be able to produce 80,000 tons of seed cotton, 32,000 tons of lint, 24,000 tons of cotton yarn, 91.5 million meters of cotton cloth, annual sales revenue of RMB 1.525 billion, and a profit of RMB 250 million, improving the welfare of its workers and driving industrial and agricultural development in Tajikistan. 

For a RMB 1.1 billion investment by Chinese companies for industrial park, see linked to project #54353. For a RMB 200 million loan for the industrial park from the Agricultural Bank of China, please see linked project ID#71757.

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city. It sits on the southern slope of the Gissar range. More detailed locational information can be found at http://www.cnfgold.com/Managed/Resources/docs/Downloads/srk_report.pdf.

54370,"China launched 'Hundred Talents Program' for training professional technical personnel for Central-Asia Natural Gas Project (Linked to project ID##39955, #70616)","On October 10, 2017, Xi'an Shiyou University of China held the launching ceremony of the 'Hundred Talents Program'. In 2016, Xi'an Shiyou University successfully won the bid for the TTGP foreign employee training project. After the launching of Central-Asia Natural Gas Project (captured in #39955), according to the agreement between the governments of China and Tajikistan, China will train 90 relevant professional localized technical personnel for Tajikistan. Therefore, TTGP actively sought out Chinese partner universities to undertake the localized staff training tasks required for the construction and operation of the pipeline. According to the agreement, the company will select the first group of 30 students from Tajikistan to come to China to study Chinese language and oil and gas pipeline transportation and other professional academic education, and become the first group of students to come to China in the TTGP China-Tajikistan school-enterprise cooperation talent training project 'Hundred Talents Program'. The first thirty students to receive the training were selected from the 1,000 top students, with the assistance of National Testing Center of Tajikistan, and China National Natural Gas Pipeline Co., Ltd., under the approval of the Deputy Prime Minister of Tajikistan. The students will take Chinese language courses in Tianjin University for one year, and in Xi'an Shiyou University for another year. Then they will study the undergraduate major courses of oil and gas storage and transportation in Xi'an Shiyou University. After graduation, they will work professionally for the Line D of Central-Asia Natural Gas Project. Fifteen students out of thirty received scholarships of the 'Silk Road' Program from the Chinese Government.

40351,Chinese Government provided a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#39989),"As part of a set of high-level agreements signed at the June 15, 2006 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Chinese Government offered a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (see the cited resource:""China signs Tajik loan deals""). This project was also supported by a $281.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (see Project ID#39989).

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan had signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project.China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan tunnel. The project was wholly completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

The purpose of this project — also known as the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253-meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047-meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls .

40351,Chinese Government provided a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#39989),"As part of a set of high-level agreements signed at the June 15, 2006 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Chinese Government offered a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (see the cited resource:""China signs Tajik loan deals""). This project was also supported by a $281.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (see Project ID#39989).

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan had signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project.China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan tunnel. The project was wholly completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

The purpose of this project — also known as the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253-meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047-meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls .

40351,Chinese Government provided a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (Linked to Project ID#39989),"As part of a set of high-level agreements signed at the June 15, 2006 meeting of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), the Chinese Government offered a RMB 60 million grant for the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project (see the cited resource:""China signs Tajik loan deals""). This project was also supported by a $281.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (see Project ID#39989).

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan had signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project.China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan tunnel. The project was wholly completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

The purpose of this project — also known as the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253-meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047-meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls .

40406,"China provides an RMB 260 million grant for the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project (Linked to Project IDs #53615, #72465)","In 2006, the Chinese Government provided RMB 260 million in grant funding to support the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project. Previously, in July 2005, China and Tajikistan reached an agreement for providing assistance for the construction of the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel. 

China Railway No.5 Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), was the contractor responsible for project implementation. CCCC Highway Consultants Co., Ltd. undertook preliminary design of the project. Xinjiang Highway Engineering Supervision Center was responsible for supervision of construction. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 20, 2006. The construction was scheduled to be completed in 34 months (see ""Update: Construction of Shar-Shar tunnel in Khatlon officially begins""). The project was completed on August 8, 2009. A grand opening ceremony was held on August 30. In November 2010, the project won the China Construction Engineering Luban Prize.

The Shar-Shar Tunnel Project (alternatively: Sharshar) included a main tunnel with a total length of 2.23 km and a 4.91 km connection line (3.4 km for the northern connection line, 1.5 km for the southern connection line) and a 169-meter-long bridge in a mountainous and hilly area. This project aimed to promote general economic development. It also hoped to improve traffic conditions in Tajikistan, as well as strengthen business and logistics links between China and Tajikistan. Upon completion, the tunnel was to reportedly reduce the travel time from Dushanbe to Dangara, President Emomali Rahmon's hometown, by 40 minutes. 

This tunnel was located 80 km south of the capital city of Dushanbe, near the city of Kulyab in the Dangara District of Khatlon Region. It is on the Dushanbe-Vahdat-Dangara highway and was built under Shar-Shar mountain pass. More detailed locational information can be found at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/ozodi-tunnel-construction/4c72ae7b-1c6b-4466-91b7-3092ba7ee8e4/.

This project is linked to ID#53615, which covers a Chinese Government grant to repair a 6 km access road to the Shar-Shar Tunnel, and #72465, a follow up grant in 2007.

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 沙尔—沙尔隧道. The Russian project title is Ремонт подходных путей к тоннелю Озоди (Шар-Шар). The project is also known as the ""Shahr-Shahr Tunnel and the North-South Link Project"" (see ""援塔吉克斯坦沙尔-沙尔隧道和南北连接线项目竣工典礼隆重举行""). The Shar-Shar tunnel was renamed the Ozodi (in English: Liberty) tunnel in 2014 (see ""Chormaghzak Tunnel renamed Khatlon Tunnel and Shar-Shar Tunnel renamed Ozodi Tunnel""). 

The Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS) identifies $41,664,633 as the amount of grant funding provided by the Chinese Government. This project is identified by identification number TJK/102014 in the AIMS, and its title in the AIMS is 'Construction of auto-tunnel Shar-shar'' (see ""May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS China Specific Projects"" resource). However, we chose to code the RMB 260 million estimate provided by the China’s Embassy in Tajikistan since the Chinese Government typically denominates its grant agreements in RMB and in a Speech of the Chancellery of the Adviser for Trade and Economic Issues of the PRC, the grant was denominated in RMB.

72465,"China grants 79 million RMB to Tajikistan for the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project (Linked with projects #40406, #53615)","In 2007, the Chinese Government provided RMB 79 million in grant funding to support the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project. Previously, in July 2005, China and Tajikistan reached an agreement for providing assistance for the construction of the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel. This grant funding was not only used for direct tunnel construction but for the provision of buses,  Mobile inspection and observation complex, radiotechnics and other systems, though the specific breakdown is unknown.

China Railway No.5 Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), was the contractor responsible for project implementation. CCCC Highway Consultants Co., Ltd. undertook preliminary design of the project. Xinjiang Highway Engineering Supervision Center was responsible for supervision of construction. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 20, 2006. The construction was scheduled to be completed in 34 months (see ""Update: Construction of Shar-Shar tunnel in Khatlon officially begins""). The project was completed on August 8, 2009. A grand opening ceremony was held on August 30. In November 2010, the project won the China Construction Engineering Luban Prize.

The Shar-Shar Tunnel Project (alternatively: Sharshar) included a main tunnel with a total length of 2.23 km and a 4.91 km connection line (3.4 km for the northern connection line, 1.5 km for the southern connection line) and a 169-meter-long bridge in a mountainous and hilly area. This project aimed to promote general economic development. It also hoped to improve traffic conditions in Tajikistan, as well as strengthen business and logistics links between China and Tajikistan. Upon completion, the tunnel was to reportedly reduce the travel time from Dushanbe to Dangara, President Emomali Rahmon's hometown, by 40 minutes. 

This tunnel was located 80 km south of the capital city of Dushanbe, near the city of Kulyab in the Dangara District of Khatlon Region. It is on the Dushanbe-Vahdat-Dangara highway and was built under Shar-Shar mountain pass. More detailed locational information can be found at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/ozodi-tunnel-construction/4c72ae7b-1c6b-4466-91b7-3092ba7ee8e4/.

This project is linked to ID#53615, which covers a Chinese Government grant to repair a 6 km access road to the Shar-Shar Tunnel, and #40406, an earlier donation for the same project

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 沙尔—沙尔隧道. The Russian project title is Ремонт подходных путей к тоннелю Озоди (Шар-Шар). The project is also known as the ""Shahr-Shahr Tunnel and the North-South Link Project"" (see ""援塔吉克斯坦沙尔-沙尔隧道和南北连接线项目竣工典礼隆重举行""). The Shar-Shar tunnel was renamed the Ozodi (in English: Liberty) tunnel in 2014 (see ""Chormaghzak Tunnel renamed Khatlon Tunnel and Shar-Shar Tunnel renamed Ozodi Tunnel""). 

The Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS) identifies $41,664,633 as the amount of grant funding provided by the Chinese Government. This project is identified by identification number TJK/102014 in the AIMS, and its title in the AIMS is 'Construction of auto-tunnel Shar-shar'' (see ""May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS China Specific Projects"" resource). However, we chose to code the RMB 260 million estimate provided by the China’s Embassy in Tajikistan since the Chinese Government typically denominates its grant agreements in RMB and in a Speech of the Chancellery of the Adviser for Trade and Economic Issues of the PRC, the grant was denominated in RMB.

46211,"China Eximbank provides RMB 929.9 million government concessional loan for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #54106, #71101, #71137)","On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two Chinese banks to Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown. Project ID#54106 only captures the $15 million USD from China Eximbank. China Development Bank's contribution was captured in project ID#71101. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of ""Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...""; for the PBC loan amount, see ""Information on existing state investment projects""). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see ""РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита""). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018"").

The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ""Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe.""

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan""). Another media source, Asia-Plus reported that the license for development of the Upper Kumargh gold deposit was granted to TBEA in 2018. It also reported that in 2013, the Tajik Government gave TBEA licenses for exploration operations at both these deposits until 2017, while also exempting TBEA from customs duties and value added tax on the import of equipment (see ""China's TBEA granted licenses for development of two gold deposits in Tajikistan"").

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

71443,China Eximbank provides $36.9 million preferential buyer’s credit for the Upgrade of the Vahdat-Yavan Section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#40489),"On November 7, 2014, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed two loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Upgrade of the Vahdat-Yavan Section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube Railway Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest, 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period), each with a bank service fee of 0.2% and a reservation fee of 0.2%).

On August 13, 2013, State Unitary Enterprise “Rohi Ohani Tojikiston” had signed a contract for the survey, design and construction of tunnels and bridges of the new Dushanbe-Kurgan-Tyube railway, Vahdat-Yavan section for $59,993,900 USD. The Government of Tajikistan approved this deal on August 28, 2013, and ordered the Ministry of Finance to attract a soft loan from China Eximbank. The total cost of the project was approximately $71.993 million USD. The loans from the Export-Import Bank of China were valued at $68,992,970 USD. Tajikistan contributed $2,999,700 USD through State Unitary Enterprise ""Rohi Ohani Tojikiston” (see ""Information on existing state investment projects"" and ""Строительство мостов и тоннелей на железной дороги Душанбе-Кургантюбе, участок Вахдат-Яван"" from the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Tajikistan).

The face value of the GCL loan was RMB 191.9 million. The face value of the PBC loan was $36.9 million USD (pg.5 of “Отчет о состоянии государственного долга на 2014 год”). These loans combined are roughly equal to the reported Eximbank contribution. The loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. Project ID#40489 records the GCL and Project ID#71443 records the PBC.

This project was to become the first railway project launched and completed under the framework of the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" initiative, and was to become a hub of an international railway network connecting China, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. China Railway 19th Bureau Group Co Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 15, 2015 and the project was completed on August 24, 2016.

This project involved the construction of construction of 5 bridges and 3 tunnels along the Vakhdat-Yavan section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube railway.

71411,China Eximbank provides $12.54 million preferential buyer's credit for Safe City Project (Linked to Project ID#46215),"On May 20, 2013, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed two loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Safe City Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20-year maturity, 11-year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest, 20-year maturity, 9-year grace period).

The precise face value of the GCL loan and the precise face value of the PBC loan are unknown. However, it is known that the GCL and PBC are jointly worth $20.9 million USD, and that 40% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($8.36 million) came from the RMB-denominated GCL and 60% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($12.54 million) came from the USD-denominated PBC (AidData learned this through correspondence with the IMF, see ""Following Up"" resource). Project ID#46215 records the GCL and project ID#71411 records the PBC.

The loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament in June 2013 and were expected to be repaid with revenues from the traffic fines generated by this project. The total cost of the project was $22 million USD. In addition to the Chinese loans, the Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.1 million USD.

According to Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Safe City Project involved the installation of 855 CCTV cameras for round-the-clock monitoring of traffic and other movements at 75 crossroads, streets, and squares in the capital city of Dushanbe. The cameras were to record every offense committed by drivers, which would be stored and processed in a common database. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was responsible for project implementation. Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs was also responsible for the undertaking of the project.

The Safe City project and the control center were officially launched on October 31, 2013 by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. The Safe City Project was to be carried out in three stages; the second stage was expected to be finished in May 2014. The project was still on going as of December 2014. As of January 16, 2015, it had reportedly generated $4 million for the Tajik state budget via traffic fines. According to a Huawei report issued in February 2015, Huawei completed the project successfully.

Ltd (CNMIM) provided a secured loan facility on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project —  for $10 million and RMB 530 million to finance the development of the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70174 and #70319).

Then, on June 19, 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited provided a $120 million term loan facility to China Nonferrous Mining Group for the Pakrut Gold Project.
The loan was secured by standby letters of credit. The loans advanced under the facility could not exceed 95% of the value of the standby letters of credit. Standby letters of credit were issued on June 24, 2014 and June 18, 2015 in order to enable China Nonferrous Mining Group to drawdown $80 million and $40 million respectively under the facility. The principal loan repayments commenced on January 30, 2016. As of December 31, 2015, China Nonferrous Mining Group had fully drawn down the loan facility extended (see pg.29 of ""Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2015""). The loan availability period ran from July 9, 2014 until June 19, 2015. If the facility was not fully drawn down within the loan availability period, the principal repayments were to be reduced in inverse order of the repayment schedule. In the event of default, ICBC had the right to demand full repayment of the outstanding loan and charge default interest at 3% over the contracted interest rate. The loan was secured by China Nonferrous. 

The interest rate on the loan was 2.90% per annum over the quarterly (3-month) LIBOR rate (average 3-month LIBOR rate in June 2014 was 0.231%). Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 2.90+.231=3.131%. The loan was repayable in USD. The principal loan repayment commenced on January 30, 2016 (see pg.29-30 of ""Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2015"").

The repayment schedule was as follows, denominated in USD (see pg.46 of ""Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2015""):
- January 30, 2016 – $5,000,000
- July 30, 2016 – $10,000,000
- January 30, 2017 – $10,000,000
- July 30, 2017 – $15,000,000
- January 30, 2018 – $20,000,000

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 112 km from the city of Dushanbe (see ""Final Results and Notice of AGM""). Relevant geological exploration at the Pakrut deposit began in 2004 (see pp.iii ""Independent Technical Report of the Pakrut Gold Project in Vahdat Region, Republic of Tajikistan. 

According to the 2018 report published on Bloomberg, in November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining license to LLC Pakrut. According to SRK, at a gold cut-off of 1.0 g/t, the JORC Code compliant Proved Ore Reserves for Pakrut were estimated at 15,721 thousand tonnes (“kt”) averaging 3.1 g/t of gold. The JORC Code compliant Probable Ore Reserves were estimated at 2,787 kt averaging 2.5 g/t of gold. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

70446,Chinese Government loans RMB 50 million to restructure debt for Dushanbe Cigarette Factory Project,"In January 1997, Xinjiang International Economic Cooperation Corporation and Tadushanbe Cigarette Factory established a Sino-Tajik joint venture cigarette factory, the Dushanbe Cigarette Factory. The Chinese accounted for 10% of the registered capital ($300,000 USD), while Tajikistan accounted for 90%. The joint venture had a period of 30 years. The joint venture used a RMB 50 million government loan provided in 1994 to technically transform the tobacco factory, and the Chinese side provided cigarette and printing production lines. After the transformation, the production capacity of the factory was 5 billion cigarettes per year. The construction officially started in November 1998 and the project was completed in February 2001, and was officially handed over to Tajikistan in November 2001. However, the project was shelved because of tariff issues until October 2002. After that, the tobacco factory began trial production; producing 80 cases (800,000 cigarettes) of cigarettes per day, according to Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Tajikistan in 2003.

The joint venture was to repay the RMB 50 million loan in installments from December 1, 2002. Since the joint venture tobacco factory was in a state of intermittent operation at that time, the supply of raw materials required was not timely, and revenue was not yet generated. So, Prime Minister Akilov of the Tajik government sent a letter to Premier Zhu Rongji in 2002 to propose debt relief or extension. A loan repayment proposal was then formally proposed with a loan period of 20 years, with a grace period of 5 years, with a reduced interest rate of 1%, according to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Tajikistan in 2003. In 2006, the Economic and Commercial Office reported that the factory was looking for a Chinese company, in the form of our shareholding or other joint venture, to partner with it and introduce technical personnel, management experience and increase its working capital, so that the factory can operate normally.

Ltd (CNMIM) and Kryso Resources PLC signed a Shareholder Loan Agreement for a loan made on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project.

The secured loan facility consisted of two tranches; a tranche for RMB 530 million and a tranche for $10 million USD. It was to be used exclusively for the design, construction, operation and administration of the Pakrut Gold Project, including operating costs, capital expenditure, and general working capital. The USD tranche was disbursed by CNMIM transferring the funds into a designated bank account of the Kryso. The term of the loan went from the date of the first advance until May 31, 2017. The annual fixed interest rate was 9% for both tranches and a management fee at 0.5% on the total amount of the loan was paid within 30 days of the first advance. Default interest of 13.5% per annum was payable on overdue amounts on the tranches. The Group was to repay all amounts of principal and interest in respect in USD at the fixed exchange rate of $1 USD to 6.30 RMB.

This project only captures the USD tranche of the loan facility. For the RMB tranche, please see Project ID #70319.

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 112 km from the city of Dushanbe (see ""Final Results and Notice of AGM""). Relevant geological exploration at the Pakrut deposit began in 2004 (see pp.iii ""Independent Technical Report of the Pakrut Gold Project  in Vahdat Region, Republic of Tajikistan. According to the 2018 report published on Bloomberg, in November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining license to LLC Pakrut. According to SRK, at a gold cut-off of 1.0 g/t, the JORC Code compliant Proved Ore Reserves for Pakrut were estimated at 15,721 thousand tonnes (“kt”) averaging 3.1 g/t of gold. The JORC Code compliant Probable Ore Reserves were estimated at 2,787 kt averaging 2.5 g/t of gold. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

40479,"China Development Bank provides $140 million loan for Technological Innovation of ZGC Gold Mine (Linked to Project ID#72389, #72802, #40482, #40481, #69997)","On May 19, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and Zijin Mining Group signed a loan agreement with JV Zeravshan LLC (formerly known as Zervashan Gold Company) -- a special purpose vehicle -- worth $140 million USD, according to the Times of Asia. The proceeds from the loan were to be used for the Technological Innovation of ZGC Gold Mine in Tajikistan, a project that aimed to expand the production capacity of a gold mine in the town of Panjakent within Zarafshon in northern Tajikistan.

According to pg. 37 of the 2013 Annual Report from Zijin (published March 28, 2014), the project had entered implementation and achieved the following objectives: (1) The stripping of infrastructure of Jilao open-pit mine and Taror openpit mine had been completed for over 90% and 80%, respectively; (2) The reformation of industrial pilot production processing technology of Taror oxide ore processing plant had been completed; and (3) The Jilao 10,000 tonnes processing plant project had entered into civil engineering construction and installation stage. Upon completion, the project was to increase the mine's production to 3.5 tonnes of gold per year.

This project was one of many signed during the same visit of the President of Tajikistan to China from May 19th 2013 to May 20th 2013. The other projects were: Loans totaling 33 million RMB to Amonatbonk (captured in project ID#69997), a 200 million RMB grant (captured in project ID#40481), an agreement for the reconstruction of Regar Substation (captured in project ID#40482), loans totaling 20 million USD to Amonatbonk (captured in project ID#72802), a technical cooperation agreement, a fruit inspection protocol, and a sports cooperation agreement. 

The project is linked to another Zijing Group stake acquisition project (captured in project ID#72389).

STAFF_NOTE: In 1994, Zeravshan Gold Company (ZGC) was launched as a joint venture with Nelson Resources Ltd (44%) and the Tajik Government (51%) and the IFC (5%). In September 2002, Avocet signed a heads of agreement to acquire the Tajik gold assets of Toronto-based Nelson Resources Ltd held through Nelson’s subsidiary, Commonwealth and British Minerals Ltd, including its 44% interest in ZGC. In November 2004, Avocet increased its equity interest in ZGC from 49% to 75%. In 2007, Zijin paid $429.8 million HKD to acquire Avocet's stake. In February 2018, Zijin Mining, sold 5% of its shares in JV Zarafshon (its new name) to the Tajik government for $1.00 USD. With this, Zijin's share decreased to 70% ($16,974,364 USD), while the Tajik government's share rose to 30% ($7,274,724 USD) (see ""China’s Zijin Mining sells 5 percent of shares in JV Zarafshon to Tajik government for…1.00 USD"").","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CEASEN0020130520e95k0002t&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=TCASIA0020130523e95k0004s&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oVm_aGZNqIwYODWQBV4VyDjLInswZV6F/view?usp=sharing, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.timesca.com/index.php/news/8025-china-allocates-140-million-for-tajik-gold-mining-company, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.minexforum.com/en/tajik-chinese-joint-gold-mining-venture-resumes-operations/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.zijinmining.com/upload/file/2016/08/09/41461d27de4d4afeaaf5819c94158a72.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.zijinmining.com/Portals/1/LTN2014042916422013%20Annual%20Report.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.zijinmining.com/Portals/1/%E5%85%AC%E5%91%8A/2013%20Interim%20Report.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www1.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2017/0428/ltn201704281906.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/758041468011103090/pdf/ACS88340WP0P1331680Box385243B00PUBLIC0.pdf , Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180219ee2j00001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CEASEN0020180219ee2j000b6&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180209ee2900003&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180115ee1f0002t&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=TRENDE0020180219ee2j000gs&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CEASEN0020130520e95k0002t&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=TCASIA0020130523e95k0004s&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180219ee2j00001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CEASEN0020180219ee2j000b6&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180209ee2900003&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020180115ee1f0002t&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=TRENDE0020180219ee2j000gs&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",This gold mine is located in the town of Panjakent within Aini District and Sughd province.,no,https://gist.github.com/abgaddi/0af33a5e6f3d0e32e9e485edac44b1ca,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Panjakent,+Tajikistan/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x38b33a751b160567:0x71d94cecd4c991ac?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj48oC3xPzuAhXGMlkFHdZtAkgQ8gEwFnoECBwQAQ",Pandjakent division is coded for this project since the gold mine received funding is located here.

70407,"China Construction Bank provides $20 million loan to China Nonferrous Gold Limited for working capital and restoring the production of Pakrut Gold Project (Linked to Project ID#54361, #70174, #70220, #70319, #70324, #70354, #70367, #70430)","On May 24, 2012, China Nonferrous Metals International Mining Co. Ltd (CNMIM) provided a secured loan facility on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project — for $10 million and RMB 530 million to finance the development of the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70174 and #70319). Then, on June 19, 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited provided a $120 million term loan facility to China Nonferrous Mining Group for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70220). Then, on May 6, 2016, China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained a loan facility $120 million from CNMC International Capitals Company Limited (“CNMC”)— an associate of CNMIM — to refinance the loan facility that it contracted with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited on June 19, 2014 for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70324). On June 27, 2016 the China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained another loan, worth $19,114,809, from CNMIM for working capital purposes related to the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70354). Then, on July 1, 2016, China Construction Bank Corporation Macau Branch (CCBC) provided a loan facility of $100 million to China Nonferrous Mining Group to refinance its 2012 loan agreement with CNMIM (see linked Projects IDs #70367).

It was announced on October 30, 2017 that China Construction Bank Corporation Macau Branch agreed to provide China Nonferrous Gold with a loan facility of up to $20 million. The loan facility was for a maximum of one year and repayable 12 months after the first drawdown. The loan included an annual interest rate of 1.3% plus 3-month LIBOR and was governed by the law of Macau. The average 3-month LIBOR rate in October 2017 was 1.361%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 1.361+1.3=2.661%. The facility was secured by a standby letter of credit from China Construction Bank Corporation Beijing Branch, for the aggregate amount of $20,618,556.70, which expired 12 months after the date of first drawdown (1-year maturity). A standby letter of credit fee of 1.15% was payable per annum. The CCBC Loan was expected to be drawn down shortly after its signing and was to be used for working capital and to fund the restoration of production of the Pakrut gold mine (see ""Financial Update"" from October 30, 2017).

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city. It sits on the southern slope of the Gissar range. More detailed locational information can be found at http://www.cnfgold.com/Managed/Resources/docs/Downloads/srk_report.pdf.

70059,China Development Bank provides $70.6 million loan to CJSC TK Mobile for CDMA National Network Project (Linked to Project ID#71575),"In December 2006, the China Development Bank (CDB) provided a US $70.6 million loan to Closed Joint-Stock Company CJSC TK Mobile (a Tajik-Chinese mobile phone operator). The loan was meant to be used to finance the CDMA National Network Project and the purchasing of equipment and services from ZTE. The loan has a maturity of 9 years. In May 2019, ZTE provided a guarantee by pledging its 51% equity interest in CJSC TK Mobile as the provision of guarantee, with a term from the date on which the Agreement on the Pledge of Equity Interests is executed and becomes effective to the date on which the debts owed by CJSC TK Mobile under the financing documents are fully repaid. 

The CDMA National Network Project entailed the purchase of telecommunications equipment, relevant software and services for the construction of the CDMA 800M national network in Tajikistan.

STAFF_NOTE: CJSC TK Mobile is a telecommunications operator established in Tajikistan in December 2003 as a joint venture by ZTE and Service Svyaz Komplect (‘‘CCK’’) with a registered capital of US$4,000,000.

71391,China Eximbank provides $35.4 million government concessional loan for Tajik Aluminum Company (TALCO) to launch three new plants (Linked to Project ID#53755),"On July 24, 2014, Tajik Aluminum Company (TALCO) signed an EPC agreement with China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) for the Fluoride Salt Project. The project included the construction of three large plants in the Yovon District of Khatlon Region: a plant for the production of aluminum fluoride with annual capacity of 18,000 tons, a plant for the production of cryolite with annual capacity of 12,000 tons, and the plant for the production of sulfuric acid with annual capacity of 130,000 tons. These three plants were sometimes referred to as three separate projects: the Cryolite Project, the Aluminum Fluoride Project, and the Sulfuric Acid Project. 

The total cost of these projects was roughly $126 million USD. TALCO itself will invest approximately $37 million in the plants. On November 7, 2014, to finance the rest of the project, during the Beijing APEC Summit and under the witness of Xi Jinping and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon (see ""塔铝项目贷款协议正式签订"" from CNMC), the Export-Import Bank of China agreed to provide two loans to the Tajik Ministry of Finance for the Flouride Salt Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a $53.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period).

The precise face value of the GCL loan and the precise face value of the PBC loan are unknown. However, it is known that the GCL and PBC are jointly worth $88.5 million, and AidData learned through correspondence with the IMF that 40% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($35.4 million) came from the RMB-denominated GCL and 60% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($53.1 million) came from the USD-denominated PBC. The loan agreements were finalized between Ministry of Finance and China Eximbank on November 7, 2014. Project ID#53755 records the PBC and Project ID#71391 records the GCL. They were then ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. 

The project was located in Yovon District within Khatlon Region. Its exact locational coordinates are 38° 32' 45""N, 68° 13' 31"" E (see ""TALCO"" from Sulphuric Acid on the Web). Construction was undertaken by the EPC contractor (CHMC) and these three plants were completed and officially inaugurated by Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon on September 6, 2016.

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of the project is 塔铝项目. The Russian name of the project is Строительство заводов по производству криолита, фтористого алюминия и серной кислоты в рамках реконструкции и модернизации ТАЛКО. 

Aluminum fluoride is an inorganic compound used primarily in the production of aluminum. This colorless solid can be prepared synthetically, but also occurs naturally. Aluminum fluoride is an important additive for the production of aluminum by electrolysis. Together, with cryolite, it lowers the melting point to below 1000°C and increases the conductivity of the solution. Cryolite was historically used as an ore of aluminum, and later in the electrolytic processing of the aluminum-rich oxide ore bauxite. The difficulty of separating aluminum from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide minerals. Pure cryolite melts at 1012°C, and it can dissolve the aluminum oxides sufficiently to allow for the easy extraction of the aluminum by electrolysis. Substantial energy is still needed for both heating the materials and the electrolysis, but it is much more energy-efficient than melting the oxides themselves. Since natural cryolite is too rare to be used for this purpose, synthetic sodium aluminum fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite. Sulfuric acid has a wide range of applications, including domestic acidic drain cleaner, electrolyte in lead-acid batteries, and various cleaning agents. It is also a central substance in the chemical industry. Principal uses include mineral processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis. It is widely produced with different methods, such as contact process, wet sulfuric acid process and some other methods (see ""http://www.sulphuric-acid.com/sulphuric-acid-on-the-web/acid%20plants/TALCO.htm"").

The Tajik Aluminum Company is one of the ten largest aluminum smelters in the world. It provides up to 70% of Tajikistan's foreign currency earnings while consuming 40% of its electrical power. TALCO is wholly owned by the Tajik Government. Tajikistan does not mine alumina, but imports the raw material through tolling arrangements.","Industry, Mining, Construction","http://en.chmc.cc/contents/2786/44705.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://minfin.tj/downloads/ochet%20vnesh%20dolg_2014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/press-relizy/2015/TJ/Press_reliz_realizatsiya_strategii_Talco_tj.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.sulphuric-acid.com/sulphuric-acid-on-the-web/acid%20plants/TALCO.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://asiaplustj.info/ru/news/tajikistan/economic/20150114/eksimbank-kitaya-vydelit-talko-okolo-88-mln-na-stroitelstvo-dvukh-novykh-predpriyatii, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/prochee/Sadoi_Mardum_12_2015.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/doklady/Vistuplenie_na_vstreche_s_activom_zavoda_19.01.2016.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vo0gz8bocs15460/Vistuplenie_na_vstreche_s_activom_zavoda_19.01.2016.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdah2mthpot0thj/FW-%20Following%20up.eml?dl=0, Other; https://www.dropbox.com/s/15efu2nx5saapnr/List%20of%20Chinese%20Government-Financed%20Projects%20in%20Tajikistan%20from%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Finance%20via%20the%20IMF%20May%202018.xlsx?dl=0, Other; http://tj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201501/20150100873459.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sinomach.com.cn/en/MediaCenter/Magazine/201706/P020170710603705694892.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.jinocco.com/newsshow.php?SortID=2&Id=420&language=en, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx5b7d2wyhiy6dz/Today%20_%20Tajik%20Aluminum%20Company.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.portali-huquqi.tj/publicadliya/view_qonunhoview.php?showdetail=&asosi_id=16734, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sinomach.com.cn/xwzx/zgsdt/2019_qydt/201911/t20191108_225890.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/103/50275.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/103/40596.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/2353/38025.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://nm.tj/economy/43118-talko-oprovergaet-obvineniya-minfina-o-sokrytii-dohodov.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://russian.china.org.cn/exclusive/txt/2015-01/27/content_34665973_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.tajweek.tj/view/v-tadzhikistane-podgotovlen-zakonoproekt-zakona-o-nauchnoy-deyatelnosti/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://news.tj/en/news/tajikistan/economic/20160725/three-plants-talco-expected-be-introduced-operation-yovon-next-month, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.president.tj/en/node/12934, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thefreelibrary.com/China+to+start+implementation+of+%241.5+billion+worth+projects+in...-a0389850567, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thefreelibrary.com/China+to+provide+%2488-mln+loan+to+build+three+plants+in+Tajikistan.-a0397408318, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tj.chineseembassy.org/chn/dszl/dshd/t1406431.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20160726132333/https://www.asiaplus.tj/en/news/three-plants-talco-expected-be-introduced-operation-yovon-next-month, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tj.chineseembassy.org/chn/sbgx/t1599096.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",NA,"The project is located in Yovon District within Khatlon Province.

43724,China Eximbank provides $26.4 million preferential buyer’s credit for Unified Power System in Northern Tajikistan Project,"On July 20, 2011, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $26,463,789 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Unified Power System in Northern Tajikistan Project. This loan carried a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and a 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). The entire project had a cost of $27,857,000 million USD. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.4 million USD to the project.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend — through subsidiary loan agreement No. 2011(19) TOTAL (170) – 030 BT, dated July 20, 2011 — to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between July 20, 2011 and March 21, 2031. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

According to Asia-Plus, the loan was to be used to finance the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, because the operating substation, Khujand-500, was not able to ensure regular electricity supplies to northern Tajikistan through the 550 kV South-North power transmission line (also Chinese-financed, project ID #39644 and #70910). Construction of the Sughd-500 substation was also intended to promote the implementation of the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Trade and Transmission Project (CASA 1000), which aimed to establish the necessary transmission and trading infrastructure and systems to enable a trade of surplus electricity from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Chinese company TBEA was responsible for implementation. According to Asia-Plus, the project was to begin in October 2011 and be finished by the end of the year. However, the completed project was not accepted by Tajikistan until March 15, 2013 (approved by the government on October 4, 2013) (see ""Постановление Правительства Республики Таджикистан от 4 октября 2013 года, № 444..."").

This project involved the construction of a unified power system/single power grid through the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, in the north of Tajikistan, near Jamoat Lolazor in Devashtich District. More locational details can be found at https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52122/52122-001-rp-en.pdf.

Additionally, in October 2011, Minister of Finance Safarali Najmiddinov said that the loan had an annual interest rate of 2.0 percent for 33 years with a seven-year grace period, as relayed by Asia-Plus. However, according to the IMF in 2018, this loan had a maturity of 20 years, a grace period from 5 to 7 years, and an annual interest rate of 2% interest rate.

39989,China Eximbank provides $281.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40351),"On June 15, 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed a $281,105,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project. The PBC loan carried a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see loan details at ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The loan was set to disburse in 3 annual tranches. The loan disbursements were as follows (see pg.7 of ""INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation""):
- 2007: $112.4 million USD
- 2008: $112.4 million USD
- 2009: $56.2 million USD

The project had a total cost of $295.9 million USD. This project is linked to project ID#40351, a RMB 60 million grant offered by the Chinese Government. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses. More detailed locational information is available at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/carec-dushanbe-chanak-highway-including-shahristan-and-dusty-tunnels-rehabilitation/d0fdfa30-2790-41ab-8462-fb056c335c52/.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

39989,China Eximbank provides $281.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40351),"On June 15, 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed a $281,105,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project. The PBC loan carried a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see loan details at ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The loan was set to disburse in 3 annual tranches. The loan disbursements were as follows (see pg.7 of ""INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation""):
- 2007: $112.4 million USD
- 2008: $112.4 million USD
- 2009: $56.2 million USD

The project had a total cost of $295.9 million USD. This project is linked to project ID#40351, a RMB 60 million grant offered by the Chinese Government. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses. More detailed locational information is available at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/carec-dushanbe-chanak-highway-including-shahristan-and-dusty-tunnels-rehabilitation/d0fdfa30-2790-41ab-8462-fb056c335c52/.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

39989,China Eximbank provides $281.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40351),"On June 15, 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed a $281,105,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project. The PBC loan carried a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see loan details at ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The loan was set to disburse in 3 annual tranches. The loan disbursements were as follows (see pg.7 of ""INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation""):
- 2007: $112.4 million USD
- 2008: $112.4 million USD
- 2009: $56.2 million USD

The project had a total cost of $295.9 million USD. This project is linked to project ID#40351, a RMB 60 million grant offered by the Chinese Government. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses. More detailed locational information is available at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/carec-dushanbe-chanak-highway-including-shahristan-and-dusty-tunnels-rehabilitation/d0fdfa30-2790-41ab-8462-fb056c335c52/.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

39989,China Eximbank provides $281.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40351),"On June 15, 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed a $281,105,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project. The PBC loan carried a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see loan details at ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The loan was set to disburse in 3 annual tranches. The loan disbursements were as follows (see pg.7 of ""INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation""):
- 2007: $112.4 million USD
- 2008: $112.4 million USD
- 2009: $56.2 million USD

The project had a total cost of $295.9 million USD. This project is linked to project ID#40351, a RMB 60 million grant offered by the Chinese Government. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses. More detailed locational information is available at https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/carec-dushanbe-chanak-highway-including-shahristan-and-dusty-tunnels-rehabilitation/d0fdfa30-2790-41ab-8462-fb056c335c52/.

40489,China Eximbank provides RMB 191.9 million government concessional loan for the Upgrade of the Vahdat-Yavan Section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube Railway Project (Linked to Project ID#71443),"On November 7, 2014, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed two loan agreements with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Upgrade of the Vahdat-Yavan Section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube Railway Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest, 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period), each with a bank service fee of 0.2% and a reservation fee of 0.2%).

On August 13, 2013, State Unitary Enterprise “Rohi Ohani Tojikiston” had signed a contract for the survey, design and construction of tunnels and bridges of the new Dushanbe-Kurgan-Tyube railway, Vahdat-Yavan section for $59,993,900 USD. The Government of Tajikistan approved this deal on August 28, 2013, and ordered the Ministry of Finance to attract a soft loan from China Eximbank. The total cost of the project was approximately $71.993 million USD. The loans from the Export-Import Bank of China were valued at $68,992,970 USD. Tajikistan contributed $2,999,700 USD through State Unitary Enterprise ""Rohi Ohani Tojikiston” (see ""Information on existing state investment projects"" and ""Строительство мостов и тоннелей на железной дороги Душанбе-Кургантюбе, участок Вахдат-Яван"" from the Ministry of Transport of the Republic of Tajikistan).

The face value of the GCL loan was RMB 191.9 million. The face value of the PBC loan was $36.9 million USD (pg.5 of “Отчет о состоянии государственного долга на 2014 год”). These loans combined are roughly equal to the reported Eximbank contribution. The loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. Project ID#40489 records the GCL and Project ID#71443 records the PBC. 

This project was to become the first railway project launched and completed under the framework of the ""Silk Road Economic Belt"" initiative, and was to become a hub of an international railway network connecting China, Tajikistan, Afghanistan, and Iran. China Railway 19th Bureau Group Co Ltd was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 15, 2015 and the project was completed on August 24, 2016. 

This project involved the construction of construction of 5 bridges and 3 tunnels along the Vakhdat-Yavan section of the Dushanbe-Kurgantube railway.

40222,"Chinese Government grants aid worth $640,640 to Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs","In 2002, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security and the Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs (also known as the Ministry of the Interior) signed an agreement on the fight against terrorism, extremism and separatism, which included the provision of no-strings aid to Tajikistan. The aid was handed over on March 11, 2003. The aid consisted of twenty patrol cars (Radio Free Europe suggests it was 50 vehicles), special equipment, computers, laser printers, uniforms and footwear for the ministry's special subdivisions, special crime detection equipment, communication devices, night vision binoculars, cameras, metal detectors, shields, and helmets, among other goods (see BBC's 'Tajik police get 0.7m-dollar aid from China'). Material for bomb defusal was also included. Media sources indicate that the value of the aid was $700,000. However, according to the Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS as of May 2018, the Chinese government funded 'Policemen facilities' (AIMS project ID TJK/042056) worth $483,600. Additionally, there was an additional contribution of $157,040 USD for 'Different kind of equipment' (AIMS project ID TJK/042058).

The total cost of the project was $2.185 million USD. The project included the repair of the connection line base, the road surface, and the addition of water pipe bridges. 

China Railway No.5 Engineering Group, a subsidiary company of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. SIPPR Engineering Group Co., Ltd.  was responsible for construction supervision. Construction began in September 2013, and the project was completed in September 2014.

STAFF_NOTE: A 2018 export from the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS) identifies the face value of the grant as $1,223,241 (see AIMS project ID# TJK/112262) (see “May 2018 Flat Export from Tajikistan AIMS China Specific Projects”). This project is linked to project ID #40406, which was an RMB 260 million grant for the construction of the tunnel in 2006. It also linked to a series of China Eximbank-financed road segments along the Dushanbe-Dangara section of the Dushanbe-Kulma highway (Project ID#40063, Project ID#53750, and Project ID#40440). 

The Russian title of this project is Ремонт подходных путей к тоннелю Озоди (Шар-Шар). The Chinese title of this project is 援塔吉克斯坦沙尔-沙尔隧道南北连接线修复项目. The Shar-Shar tunnel was renamed the Ozodi (in English: Liberty) tunnel in 2014 (see ""Chormaghzak Tunnel renamed Khatlon Tunnel and Shar-Shar Tunnel renamed Ozodi Tunnel""). The provision year of the grant was assumed based on the start date of the project. Additionally, SIPPR's Chinese name translates to English as ""Sixth Design and Research Institute of Machinery Industry Co., Ltd.""

40051,China Eximbank provides $35 million preferential buyer’s credit for 220 kV Khujand-Ayni Power Transmission Line Project,"On November 25, 2010, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed credit agreement No. N0.2010 (024) TOTAL N0. (131). In it, Eximbank agreed to provide the Tajik Ministry of Finance with a $35,055,003 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 220 V Khujand-Ayni Power Transmission Line Project. The PBC loan carried the following terms: a 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). Total cost of the project was $36.9 million USD.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend to OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” (through a subsidiary loan agreement -- No. 2010 (024) TOTAL (170) – 029 BT) at a 3% interest rate between December 15, 2010 and September 21, 2031. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” is a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan that is responsible for the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. 

The 220kV Khujand-Ayni Power Transmission Line Project involved the construction of the Ayni and Shakhristan substations and the construction of a 118km, 220kV power transmission line from Khujand to Ayni that connects the Zarafshon Valley to the unified power system through the 500kV South-North power grid. TBEA was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 8, 2010. The power transmission line was expected to be finished by the 20th anniversary of Tajikistan’s independence, on September 9, 2011 and the transmission line was inaugurated and put into operation on September 26, 2011.

71101,"China Development Bank provides $15 million loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#46211, #54106, #71137)","On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two Chinese banks to Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown. Project ID#54106 only captures the $15 million USD from China Eximbank. China Development Bank's contribution was captured in project ID#71101. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of ""Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...""; for the PBC loan amount, see ""Information on existing state investment projects""). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see ""РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита""). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018"").

The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ""Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe.""

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan""). Another media source, Asia-Plus reported that the license for development of the Upper Kumargh gold deposit was granted to TBEA in 2018. It also reported that in 2013, the Tajik Government gave TBEA licenses for exploration operations at both these deposits until 2017, while also exempting TBEA from customs duties and value added tax on the import of equipment (see ""China's TBEA granted licenses for development of two gold deposits in Tajikistan"").

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

53755,China Eximbank provides $53.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for Tajik Aluminum Company to launch three new plants (Linked to Project ID#71391),"On July 24, 2014, Tajik Aluminum Company (TALCO) signed an EPC agreement with China National Heavy Machinery Corporation (CHMC) for the the Fluoride Salt Project. The project included the construction of three large plants in the Yovon District of Khatlon Region: a plant for the production of aluminum fluoride with annual capacity of 18,000 tons, a plant for the production of cryolite with annual capacity of 12,000 tons, and the plant for the production of sulfuric acid with annual capacity of 130,000 tons. These three plants were sometimes referred to as three separate projects: the Cryolite Project, the Aluminum Fluoride Project, and the Sulfuric Acid Project. According to ""Today"" on TALCO's website. 

The total cost of these projects was $126 million USD. TALCO itself will invest approximately $37 million in the plants. On November 7, 2014, to finance the rest of the project, during the Beijing APEC Summit and under the witness of Xi Jinping and President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon (see ""塔铝项目贷款协议正式签订"" from CNMC), the Export-Import Bank of China agreed to provide two loans to the Tajik Ministry of Finance for the Flouride Salt Project: a RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) provided on highly concessional terms (20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate) and a $53.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan on highly concessional terms (2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period). 

The precise face value of the GCL loan and the precise face value of the PBC loan are unknown. However, it is known that the combined value of GCL and PBC was $88.5 million, and AidData learned through correspondence with the IMF that 40% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($35.4 million) came from the RMB-denominated GCL and 60% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($53.1 million) came from the USD-denominated PBC. The loan agreements were finalized between Ministry of Finance and China Eximbank on November 7, 2014. Project ID#53755 records the PBC and Project ID#71391 records the GCL. They were then ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. 

The project was located in Yovon District within Khatlon Region. Its exact locational coordinates are 38° 32' 45""N, 68° 13' 31"" E. Construction was undertaken by the EPC contractor (CHMC) and these three plants were completed and officially inaugurated by Tajikistan President Emomali Rahmon on September 6, 2016. 

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of the project is 塔铝项目. The Russian name of the project is Строительство заводов по производству криолита, фтористого алюминия и серной кислоты в рамках реконструкции и модернизации ТАЛКО.

Aluminum fluoride is an inorganic compound used primarily in the production of aluminum. This colorless solid can be prepared synthetically, but also occurs naturally. Aluminum fluoride is an important additive for the production of aluminum by electrolysis. Together, with cryolite, it lowers the melting point to below 1000°C and increases the conductivity of the solution. Cryolite was historically used as an ore of aluminum, and later in the electrolytic processing of the aluminum-rich oxide ore bauxite. The difficulty of separating aluminum from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide minerals. Pure cryolite melts at 1012°C, and it can dissolve the aluminum oxides sufficiently to allow for the easy extraction of the aluminum by electrolysis. Substantial energy is still needed for both heating the materials and the electrolysis, but it is much more energy-efficient than melting the oxides themselves. Since natural cryolite is too rare to be used for this purpose, synthetic sodium aluminum fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite. Sulfuric acid has a wide range of applications, including domestic acidic drain cleaner, electrolyte in lead-acid batteries, and various cleaning agents. It is also a central substance in the chemical industry. Principal uses include mineral processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis. It is widely produced with different methods, such as contact process, wet sulfuric acid process and some other methods (see ""http://www.sulphuric-acid.com/sulphuric-acid-on-the-web/acid%20plants/TALCO.htm"").

The Tajik Aluminum Company is one of the ten largest aluminum smelters in the world. It provides up to 70% of Tajikistan's foreign currency earnings while consuming 40% of its electrical power. TALCO is wholly owned by the Tajik Government. Tajikistan does not mine alumina, but imports the raw material through tolling arrangements.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://news.tj/en/news/tajikistan/economic/20160725/three-plants-talco-expected-be-introduced-operation-yovon-next-month, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.president.tj/en/node/12934, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thefreelibrary.com/China+to+start+implementation+of+%241.5+billion+worth+projects+in...-a0389850567, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thefreelibrary.com/China+to+provide+%2488-mln+loan+to+build+three+plants+in+Tajikistan.-a0397408318, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tj.chineseembassy.org/chn/dszl/dshd/t1406431.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20160726132333/https://www.asiaplus.tj/en/news/three-plants-talco-expected-be-introduced-operation-yovon-next-month, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/15efu2nx5saapnr/List%20of%20Chinese%20Government-Financed%20Projects%20in%20Tajikistan%20from%20the%20Ministry%20of%20Finance%20via%20the%20IMF%20May%202018.xlsx?dl=0, Other; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vo0gz8bocs15460/Vistuplenie_na_vstreche_s_activom_zavoda_19.01.2016.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://minfin.tj/downloads/ochet%20vnesh%20dolg_2014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/tx5b7d2wyhiy6dz/Today%20_%20Tajik%20Aluminum%20Company.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://en.chmc.cc/contents/2786/44705.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/press-relizy/2015/TJ/Press_reliz_realizatsiya_strategii_Talco_tj.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://asiaplustj.info/ru/news/tajikistan/economic/20150114/eksimbank-kitaya-vydelit-talko-okolo-88-mln-na-stroitelstvo-dvukh-novykh-predpriyatii, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.portali-huquqi.tj/publicadliya/view_qonunhoview.php?showdetail=&asosi_id=16734, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sulphuric-acid.com/sulphuric-acid-on-the-web/acid%20plants/TALCO.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.jinocco.com/newsshow.php?SortID=2&Id=420&language=en, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/prochee/Sadoi_Mardum_12_2015.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/sdah2mthpot0thj/FW-%20Following%20up.eml?dl=0, Other; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/2353/38025.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/103/50275.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.sinomach.com.cn/xwzx/zgsdt/2019_qydt/201911/t20191108_225890.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://news.tajweek.tj/view/v-tadzhikistane-podgotovlen-zakonoproekt-zakona-o-nauchnoy-deyatelnosti/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://russian.china.org.cn/exclusive/txt/2015-01/27/content_34665973_2.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://talco.com.tj/sites/default/files/_press-services/doklady/Vistuplenie_na_vstreche_s_activom_zavoda_19.01.2016.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.sinomach.com.cn/en/MediaCenter/Magazine/201706/P020170710603705694892.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://nm.tj/economy/43118-talko-oprovergaet-obvineniya-minfina-o-sokrytii-dohodov.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chmc.cc/contents/103/40596.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://tj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201501/20150100873459.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://tj.chineseembassy.org/chn/sbgx/t1599096.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",NA,"The project is located in Yovon District within Khatlon Province.

71137,"China Eximbank provides $178.9 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #46211, #54106, #71101)","On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two Chinese banks to Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown. Project ID#54106 only captures the $15 million USD from China Eximbank. China Development Bank's contribution was captured in project ID#71101. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of ""Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...""; for the PBC loan amount, see ""Information on existing state investment projects""). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see ""РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита""). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018"").

The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034.

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ""Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe.""

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan""). Another media source, Asia-Plus reported that the license for development of the Upper Kumargh gold deposit was granted to TBEA in 2018. It also reported that in 2013, the Tajik Government gave TBEA licenses for exploration operations at both these deposits until 2017, while also exempting TBEA from customs duties and value added tax on the import of equipment (see ""China's TBEA granted licenses for development of two gold deposits in Tajikistan"").

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

Ltd (CNMIM) provided a secured loan facility on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project —  for $10 million and RMB 530 million to finance the development of the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70174 and #70319). Then, on June 19, 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited provided a $120 million term loan facility to China Nonferrous Mining Group for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70220).

Then, on May 6, 2016, China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained a $120 million from CNMC International Capitals Company Limited (“CNMC”)— an associate of China Nonferrous Metals International Mining Co. Ltd (CNMIM) — refinancing the loan facility that it contracted with ICBC on June 19, 2014 for the Pakrut Gold Project. This loan from CNMC was repayable on December 31, 2018 and included an annual fixed interest rate of 4% on the amount drawn down, payable in arrears.

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city. It sits on the on the southern slope of the Gissar range. More detailed locational information can be found at http://www.cnfgold.com/Managed/Resources/docs/Downloads/srk_report.pdf.

39984,"China Eximbank provides $55.2 million preferential buyer's credit for 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project (Linked to Project ID#39644, #70910)","In March 2006, the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a MoU for projects proposed by Tajikistan. Later, on December 16, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China provided a $58,228,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. The loan terms carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see the cited resource""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan used nearly all of the proceeds from this loan ($55,227,590, according to pg. 87 of ""Tajikistan Power Utility Financial Recovery Program"") to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement No. BLA06016) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 16, 2006 and June 21, 2026. As of December 31, 2018, $520,774 USD was outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of ""Consolidated...""). 

The initial value of the project was $58.1 million USD. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $2.9 million USD to the project. Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was launched in May 2006. The transmission line was planned to be commissioned by the end of December 2007, but the inclusion of the construction of an additional internal 110 kV transmission line from the Khatlon substation to the Bokhtar substation postponed the start date. The Lolazor-Khatlon transmission line was commissioned on June 25, 2008.

The purpose of this project was to construct a 90 km, 220 kV electricity transmission line between Dangara and Kulab. This would connect the southern region to the national grid. The new power transmission line would improve the power supply in the south of the Khatlon region, and create a more stable power supply. The Lolazor-Khatlon line had a capacity of approximately 4 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project was to provide the Khatlon region with electricity from the Sangtuda 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants, and allow for the export of electricity to Afghanistan. 

The project is linked to project ID#70910, which captured a $51 million funding from Eximbank in 2009 for both the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project and a 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project (The original financing of the 500 kV project in 2006 was captured in project ID#39644).

Later, on December 16, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China provided a $58,228,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. The loan terms carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see the cited resource""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan used nearly all of the proceeds from this loan ($55,227,590, according to pg. 87 of ""Tajikistan Power Utility Financial Recovery Program"") to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement No. BLA06016) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 16, 2006 and June 21, 2026.

Ltd (CNMIM) provided a secured loan facility on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project — for $10 million and RMB 530 million to finance the development of the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70174 and #70319). Then, on June 19, 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited provided a $120 million term loan facility to China Nonferrous Mining Group for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70220).  Then, on May 6, 2016, China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained a loan facility $120 million from CNMC International Capitals Company Limited (“CNMC”)— an associate of CNMIM — to refinance the loan facility that it contracted with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited on June 19, 2014 for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70324).

On June 27, 2016 the China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained another loan, worth $19,114,809, from CNMIM for working capital purposes related to the Pakrut Gold Project (see ""Interim Results"" published on September 30, 2016).

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city. It sits on the southern slope of the Gissar range. More detailed locational information can be found at http://www.cnfgold.com/Managed/Resources/docs/Downloads/srk_report.pdf.

54106,"China Eximbank provides $15 million loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #46211, #71101, #71137)","On July 4, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and China Development Bank (CDB) provided a $30 million USD loan for Phase 1 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. According to Trend News Agency, the project's financing was on a 50-50 basis by the two Chinese banks to Ministry of Energy and Industry of Tajikistan. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown. Project ID#54106 only captures the $15 million USD from China Eximbank. China Development Bank's contribution was captured in project ID#71101. Other detailed terms of this loan are unknown.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of ""Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...""; for the PBC loan amount, see ""Information on existing state investment projects""). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see ""РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита""). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039. The subsidiary PBC loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-1) was also signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014 and it carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 20 years. Its final maturity date was set to June 21, 2034. 

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is Душанбинская ТЭЦ-2. The $30 million loan from China Eximbank and China Development Bank may not have covered the full cost of Phase 1 of the project. In the Government of Tajikistan’s Aid Information Management System (AIMS), the project is referred to as ""Project of construction of second in succession construction of 'TPS-2' in Dushanbe."" 

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan""). Another media source, Asia-Plus reported that the license for development of the Upper Kumargh gold deposit was granted to TBEA in 2018. It also reported that in 2013, the Tajik Government gave TBEA licenses for exploration operations at both these deposits until 2017, while also exempting TBEA from customs duties and value added tax on the import of equipment (see ""China's TBEA granted licenses for development of two gold deposits in Tajikistan"").

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

70910,China Eximbank provides $51 million preferential buyer’s credit to provide additional support to 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project and 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project (Linked to Project ID#39984 and #39644),"On May 15, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China and Government of Tajikistan signed a credit agreement, according to the Tajikistan Ministry of Finance. China Eximbank agreed to provide a $51,000,000 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan (see pg. 37 of ""Consolidated financial statements...""). This loan was intended to provide additional financing to the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project and 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. Both of these projects were supported by Export-Import Bank loans approved in 2006 (see Project ID#39984 and Project ID#39644). The terms of this PBC loan are unknown.

However, it is known that the Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between May 29, 2007 and December 21, 2028. As of December 31, 2018, $480,910 USD was outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of ""Consolidated...""). 

The purpose of the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid. According to Xinhua, the project also intended to realize the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build the transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%. 

According to Asia-Plus, the purpose of the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project was to construct a 90 km, 220 kV electricity transmission line between Dangara and Kulab. This would connect the southern region to the national grid. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, relayed by Asia-Plus, the new power transmission line would improve the power supply in the south of the Khatlon region, and create a more stable power supply. The Lolazor-Khatlon line had a capacity of approximately 4 billion kWh of electricity a year, according to Asia-Plus. The project was to provide the Khatlon region with electricity from the Sangtuda 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants, and allow for the export of electricity to Afghanistan.

Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both projects (see pg. 14 of ""China as an Emerging Donor...""). The North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009 (see pg. 11 of ""BRI in Central Asia: Energy Connectivity Projects"").  According to Asia-Plus, the Lolazor-Khatlon transmission line has been operational since June 25, 2008. 

The project is linked to previous fundings of a 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line project (captured in project ID#39644) and a 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project (captured in project ID#39984) in 2006.

70319,"CNMIM provides RMB 530 million loan for Pakrut Gold Project (Linked to Project ID#54361, #70174, #70220, #70324, #70354, #70367, #70407, #70430)","On May 24, 2012, China Nonferrous Metals International Mining Co. Ltd (CNMIM) and Kryso Resources PLC signed a Shareholder Loan Agreement for a loan made on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project. 

The secured loan facility consisted of two tranches; a tranche for RMB 530 million and a tranche for $10 million USD. It was to be used exclusively for the design, construction, operation and administration of the Pakrut Gold Project, including operating costs, capital expenditure, and general working capital. The RMB tranche was disbursed by CNMIM entering into contracts with third parties on behalf of Kryso or LLC Pakrut as their agent and transferring amounts to the bank accounts of such parties. The term of the loan went from the date of the first advance until May 31, 2017. The annual fixed interest rate was 9% for both tranches and a management fee at 0.5% on the total amount of the loan was paid within 30 days of the first advance. Default interest of 13.5% per annum was payable on overdue amounts on the tranches. The Group was to repay all amounts of principal and interest in respect in USD at the fixed exchange rate of $1 USD to 6.30 RMB. The repayment dates were May 31, 2015, November 11, 2015, May 31, 2016, November 11, 2016, and May 31, 2017 for both tranches. November 30, 2014 was the end of the loan availability period. Kryso had drawn down RMB 384,802,696 (equivalent to $61,079,793 USD at the fixed repayment exchange rate) under the RMB tranche. Kryso pledged its 100% equity interest in LLC Pakrut to CNMIM as security for repayment of the loan (see pg.45-46 of ""Annual Report and Financial Statements for the Year Ended 31 December 2015"").

This project only captures the RMB tranche of the loan facility. For the USD tranche, please see Project ID #70174.

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 112 km from the city of Dushanbe (see ""Final Results and Notice of AGM""). Relevant geological exploration at the Pakrut deposit began in 2004 (see pp.iii ""Independent Technical Report of the Pakrut Gold Project  in Vahdat Region, Republic of Tajikistan. According to the 2018 report published on Bloomberg, in November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining license to LLC Pakrut. 

According to SRK, at a gold cut-off of 1.0 g/t, the JORC Code compliant Proved Ore Reserves for Pakrut were estimated at 15,721 thousand tonnes (“kt”) averaging 3.1 g/t of gold. The JORC Code compliant Probable Ore Reserves were estimated at 2,787 kt averaging 2.5 g/t of gold. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

The loan had a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 9 years, and an interest rate of 2%. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $2.7 million USD to this project. The Eximbank loan was unanimously ratified by the Tajik Parliament in October 2012.

China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on October 15, 2010, and the project was completed on October 1, 2013. This project supported the construction of the 4.43 km Chormagzak Tunnel along the 147.64 km Dushanbe-Dangara section of the Dushanbe-Kulma highway (which is also known as the Tajikistan-China highway).

STAFF_NOTE: The Chormagzak Tunnel is now known as the Khatlon Tunnel. This project is linked to the China Eximbank-financed First Stage and China Eximbank-financed Second Stage of Phase 1 of the Dushanbe-Dangara Road Reconstruction Project (see Project ID#40063, #53750). China Eximbank reportedly provided $243.4 million of debt financing in total for all three stages of Phase 1. The Russian project title for Stage 3 of Phase 1 is Реабилитация третьего этапа фазы I автомобильной дороги «Душанбе-Кульма». The Chinese project title is 塔中公路一期(杜尚别—丹卡拉段)道路修复改造项目.

Additionally, the ""Data Collection Survey On a Road Between Dushanbe and Kurgan-Tyube in the Republic of Tajikistan Final Report"" from the Japan International Cooperation Agency states that China Eximbank provided a $64 million USD loan for this project, but most of other sources (including Tajikistan Ministry report and ADB investigation) indicate that $50.54 would be a more precise number.",Transport and Storage,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASIPLU0020120605e8650005n&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

39644,"China Eximbank provides $267.2 million preferential buyer's credit for 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project (Linked to Project ID#39984, #70910)","In March 2006, the Government of Tajikistan and the Export-Import Bank of China signed a MoU for projects proposed by Tajikistan (see pg. 14 of ""China as an Emerging Donor in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan""). Later, on December 21, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China provided a $267,219,451 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project (for the transaction amount, see pg. 87 of ""Power Utility Financial Recovery Program-for-Results (P168211) Program Technical Assessment Final Report""). The loan terms carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (for the loan details, see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement (No. BLA06015, #6015) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 21, 2006 and June 21, 2026. As of December 31, 2018, $2,519,773 USD was still outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. 

The initial estimated value of the project was $281.3 million USD.The purpose of this project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid. According to Xinhua, the project also intended to realize the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build the transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%. 

Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 16, 2006. The North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009, according to TBEA's report. The construction of the 325 km, 500 kV south–north power transmission line reportedly enabled Tajikistan to become independent of the Uzbek power transmission network and to distribute electricity throughout the country. 

The project is linked to project ID#70910, which captured a $51 million funding from Eximbank in 2009 for both the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line project and a 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project (The original financing of the 220 kV project in 2006 was captured in project ID#39984).
