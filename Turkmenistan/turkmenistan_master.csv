40393,China Development Bank provides $3 billion loan for Galkynysh (South Yolotan‚ÄìOsman) Gas Field Phase I Project (Linked to Project ID#41905 and #43168),"On June 25, 2009, China Development Bank signed a $3 billion loan agreement with Turkmengaz (the national natural gas company of Turkmenistan) for Phase 1 of the Galkynysh Gas Field Project (also known as South Yolotan‚ÄìOsman Field Project). The loan is secured by natural gas exports to China.This loan was given to help develop the Galkynysh Gas Field (also known as South Yolotan‚ÄìOsman Field) while Turkmenistan will supply China with up to 40 billion cubic meters/year of gas for 30 years. They include a supplementary agreement covering CNPC's exploration and production activities at Bagitiyarlik, where the company has a license to produce up to 30 Bcm/year, and a separate contract under which state-owned Turkmengaz will deliver 10 Bcm/year to CNPC. The fact that Turkmengaz and CNPC signed a contract for the delivery of an additional 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year at the same time that the loan agreement was finalized suggests that Turkmengaz will use the revenue it earns from this supply contract for natural gas as collateral for the loan.  Few other details about the terms of the loan, including the price at which the natural gas is sold to CNPC, are publicly available.The first phase of the project began on February 28, 2011 and it was completed on September 4, 2013.   Then, in April 2013, China signed an additional $4.1 billion loan agreement with the Government of Turkmenistan for the second phase of the Galkynysh Gas Field Project. The loan will be disbursed over 3 years, and in return Turkmenistan will reportedly supply natural gas to China for 10 years (see project ID #41905).Staff Note: The Phase 1 of the Galkynysh Gas Field project is part of the umbrella project captured in project #43168.",Energy Generation and Supply,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=WDAN000020090625e56p0005x&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

69498,"China Eximbank provides a 60.6 million USD loan for construction of Ashgabat Glass Factory (Linked to Project ID#40330, #69497)","On August 22, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $300 million USD preferential export buyer's credit framework agreement with the Government of Turkmenistan (see umbrella project ID#40330). The loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an annual interest rate of 3.0%.On January 30, 2007, China National Machinery Industry Corporation, Capital-Longqji Sci-Tech Co., Ltd, signed a commercial contract with the Government of Turkmenistan for the construction and renovation of the Ashgabat Glass Factory under the USD 300 million preferential export buyer‚Äôs credit framework.Then, on November 3-4, 2007, China and Turkmenistan signed for two subsidiary loans with the same terms as the framework agreement: a loan of 60,642,000 USD was allocated for the construction of the Ashgabat Glass Factory, a glass-manufacturing plant (captured by this project) and a loan of 239,358,000 USD for the construction of new facilities and reconstruction of MaryAzot Production Association (captured in project ID#69497). To secure these loans, the Central Bank of Turkmenistan agreed to deposit 50 million USD from the State Fund for Development of the Oil and Gas Industry and Mineral Resources of Turkmenistan.The Ashgabat Glass Factory was located in the northern part of Ashgabat. It was expected to become the largest plant in the region when completed, and was to be fitted with modern equipment and mainly use locally produced raw materials. Additionally, it was expected to produce 5.8 million square meters of glass (4 mm thick), 85 million units of various glass containers, nd 300,000 square meters of double-glazing units, including toned glass units, annually. A silica sand enrichment plant capable of producing 100,000 tons annually was also included in the project. China National Machinery Industry Corporation (Sinomach) and Capital-Lonqji Sci-Tech Co., Ltd were contracted to implement the project. The plant was to be commissioned in February 2009. The entire project was reported to cost $67.38 million USD, so there were likely non-Eximbank financiers. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese title of the project is ÂúüÂ∫ìÊõºÊñØÂù¶ÁéªÁíÉÂéÇÂª∫ËÆæÈ°πÁõÆ.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=NOVA000020060824e28o0002y&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=BBCCA00020071211e3cb001md&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.cetin.net.cn/cetin2/servlet/cetin/action/HtmlDocumentAction;jsessionid=4FC102D37704901FF631F5521FDB8388?baseid=1&docno=309802, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=DLSTEN0020071109e3b50000a&cat=a&ep=ASI, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=TRENDE0020070129e31t001ry&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.chem.hc360.com/2007/02/0514555186.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LBA0000020071108e3b5001o0&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/4898, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.rferl.org/a/1070758.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.turkmenistan.ru/en/node/5259, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://search.proquest.com/docview/2095209179?pq-origsite=gscholar&fromopenview=true, Academic Journal Article; https://www.dropbox.com/s/77e5y0ofv1zfphk/%E5%9C%9F%E5%BA%93%E6%9B%BC%E6%96%AF%E5%9D%A6--%E4%B8%AD%E5%9B%BD%E5%AF%B9%E5%A4%96%E5%BC%80%E6%94%BE30%E5%91%A8%E5%B9%B4%E5%9B%9E%E9%A1%BE%E5%B1%95.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/c0so9pwet0v5tnt/Turkmenistan%20-%20Retrospective%20of%20the%2030th%20Anniversary%20of%20China%27s%20Opening%20to%20the%20Outside%20World.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=NOVA000020060824e28o0002y&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=BBCCA00020071211e3cb001md&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=DLSTEN0020071109e3b50000a&cat=a&ep=ASI, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=TRENDE0020070129e31t001ry&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LBA0000020071108e3b5001o0&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks",Ashgabat,,,,Location in location_details,good code up,https://gist.github.com/cef4e89f2056959508407cdee7f2aa44,province
