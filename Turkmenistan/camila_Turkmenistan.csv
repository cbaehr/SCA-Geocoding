41905,"China Development Bank provides $4.1 billion loan Galkynysh Gas Field Phase II Project (Linked to Project ID#40393 and #43168)","In April 2011, China Development Bank signed an loan-for-gas framework agreement with Turkmengaz (the national natural gas company of Turkmenistan) for Phase 2 of the Galkynysh Gas Field Project (also known as South Yolotan–Osman Field Project or the Ioujno-Elotenshoie Gas Field Project).Then, in September 2013, China Development Bank and Turkmengaz signed a $4.1 billion loan agreement for this project. The CDB loan is reportedly secured by natural gas exports to China. Turkmengaz will use the revenue it earns from a supply contract for natural gas as collateral for the loan. The loan will be disbursed over 3 years, and in return Turkmengaz will reportedly supply natural gas to China for 10 years.CNPC is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The purpose of phase II of this project was to build facilities at the Galkynysh Gas Field that will process 30 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year. The project entered implementation on May 8, 2014.Staff Note: This project is part of the umbrella project captured in project #43168 and it is considered to be part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

40393,"China Development Bank provides $3 billion loan for Galkynysh (South Yolotan–Osman) Gas Field Phase I Project (Linked to Project ID#41905 and #43168)","On June 25, 2009, China Development Bank signed a $3 billion loan agreement with Turkmengaz (the national natural gas company of Turkmenistan) for Phase 1 of the Galkynysh Gas Field Project (also known as South Yolotan–Osman Field Project). The loan is secured by natural gas exports to China.This loan was given to help develop the Galkynysh Gas Field (also known as South Yolotan–Osman Field) while Turkmenistan will supply China with up to 40 billion cubic meters/year of gas for 30 years. They include a supplementary agreement covering CNPC's exploration and production activities at Bagitiyarlik, where the company has a license to produce up to 30 Bcm/year, and a separate contract under which state-owned Turkmengaz will deliver 10 Bcm/year to CNPC. The fact that Turkmengaz and CNPC signed a contract for the delivery of an additional 10 billion cubic meters (bcm) per year at the same time that the loan agreement was finalized suggests that Turkmengaz will use the revenue it earns from this supply contract for natural gas as collateral for the loan.  Few other details about the terms of the loan, including the price at which the natural gas is sold to CNPC, are publicly available.The first phase of the project began on February 28, 2011 and it was completed on September 4, 2013.   Then, in April 2013, China signed an additional $4.1 billion loan agreement with the Government of Turkmenistan for the second phase of the Galkynysh Gas Field Project.
