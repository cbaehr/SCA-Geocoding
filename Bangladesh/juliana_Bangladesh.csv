33929,"Chinese Government provides RMB 239.6 million loan for Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #39369, #38969)","In 2000, the Chinese Government offered $53.29 million of debt financing to the Government of Bangladesh to build an 800 ton-per-day di-ammonia phosphate fertilizer plant in Chittagong. The total cost of the project was $59.21 million, and the Government of Bangladesh agreed to supply the remaining $6 million. Under a contract signed between China National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation Limited (COMPLANT) and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Chinese Government agreed to provide an RMB 200 million loan for the project. The loan agreement was finalized on September 13, 2000, and it carried the following terms: 20-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 0% interest rate. COMPLANT agreed to provide an additional $29.11 million from a supplier’s credit, which in turn funded with the proceeds from an export seller’s credit that it received (see Project ID#38969). A follow-on loan agreement with the Chinese Government for an “800 Metric Tons of 800 MT DI-AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE (DAP) Project” was signed on September 7, 2005 (see Government of Bangladesh loan ID# L1120050907a). This RMB 239,667,000 loan agreement carried the following terms: 16-year maturity, 4 year grace period, and a 2% interest rate. Construction of the di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer plant — known as Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) — was expected to begin at the end of 2000 and projected to commence operations within 30 months. However, the project did not commence until April 2004 and it was not completed until June 2006. In August 2016, an ammonia tank at the plant exploded, causing at least 50 people to fall sick from inhaling toxic gas. The emission of toxic ammonia at the fertilizer factory was brought under control on August 23, 2016, some 11 hours after one of two smaller 500-tonne capacity ammonia storage tanks exploded. Fifty people, including women, were admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH). BCIC, which now runs the factory, formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident. Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) is located within the Anowara Upazilla (SubDistrict) of Chittagong Division.

Each ship will have a load of 39,000 tons. The 3 new bulk oil tankers and 3 oil carriers were built by the Yangzijiang Shipbuilding (Holdings) Ltd. for the Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC), and they were expected to be delivered in 2018 to join the BSC's existing fleet of 8 ships. The keel laying for the first vessel was concluded on January 30, 2018. The second vessel — a bulk oil tanker — was launched from the slipway of New Yangzi shipyard on June 14, 2018. Two additional vessels were launched on July 25, 2018. Another vessel was launched on February 2, 2018. On January 22, 2019, a 39000DWT tanker was successfully delivered to BSC.  STAFF_NOTE: This project is also known as the 'Purchase of 6 Oil Ships Project'.

33946,"CMC provides $71 million supplier’s credit for Karnaphuli Paper Mills Modernization Project","On May 7, 2001, China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) signed supplier's credit agreement with the Government of Bangladesh for the Balancing, Modernisation, Rehabilitation and Expansion (BMRE) of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills in Chittagong. CMC, in turn, secured the funds for the supplier’s credit from an export seller’s credit from China Eximbank.  The total contract value was $84 million, and China Eximbank agreed to cover approximately 85% of the contract value, or $70.965 million. The supplier’s credit carried the following terms: 16-year maturity, 3 year grace period, and a 3.5% interest rate. The Government of Bangladesh’s loan identification number for this supplier’s credit is S1120010507a. The Karnaphuli Paper Mills BMRE Project was intended to expand the production capacity of Karnaphuli Paper Mills from 37500 metric tonnes to 85500 metric tonnes per year, as well as improve the output paper quality of the mill. In 2005, China reportedly agreed to convert the supplier's credit into a concessional loan. However, after the BNP-Jamaat alliance government assumed office, they “shelved” the project without explanation. The idea of the project resumed again in 2014, the loan was reportedly converted into a zero-interest loan worth $87 million. According to the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Relations Division (ERD), none of the committed funding had been disbursed as of June 30, 2018, so we assume that this project never reached the implementation stage. The Karnaphuli Paper Mills is located in Chandraghona in Chittagong Division.
