38349,"China Eximbank provides RMB 569.6 million government concessional loan for Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project #53584)","On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.The PBC is captured in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured here, in Project ID#38349. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become “effective” until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong.  In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy, and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019.

52654,"China Eximbank provides RMB 945,551,000 government concessional loan for construction of IV Tier National Data Center Project in Kaliakoir","On April 15, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 945,551,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Tier IV National Data Center Project in Kaliakoir. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for this China Eximbank GCL is L1120160415A. The purpose of this project was to build a flagship Tier IV Data Center in the Kaliakair Upazila within Gazipur District and the Division of Dhaka to store and process a large amount of official data. ZTE was the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC). As of 2017, the data center had been constructed, but the operational status of the data center was delayed by U.S. government sanctions on ZTE. In October 2018, the data center underwent operational tests. The project was officially completed on November 29, 2019. The Bangladesh National Data Center (NDC) is the first national data center that received both the UPTIME Tier IV design certification and facility certification in the country and is also the first data center in South Asia that got UPTIME Tier IV facility certification. In addition, the data center passed all the test items of the Uptime Tier IV construction certification, thereby being highly appraised by the Uptime Institute. During the construction of the data center, the ZTE construction team overcame a series of challenges, such as inconvenient transportation, unstable power supply, and bad weather.","Communications","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020150119eb1j000pa&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201607/20160701361505.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/most-advanced-data-centre-set-test-run-1638667, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/first-page/countrys-digital-infrastructure-boasts-tier-4-data-centre-1518802284, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thedailystar.net/business/national-data-centre-be-ready-2017-1302760, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/site/page/dbc55067-77ac-4d2d-a2a2-a7b348ff20de/Commitment-FY-2015-16, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/4okrart8vv5yqo6/IJGlobal%20-%20Tier%204%20National%20Data%20Centre%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://ictd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/ictd.portal.gov.bd/notices/47615f01_c7f9_470a_9e8c_2b367b3d124f/GO%20China.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/most-advanced-data-centre-set-test-run-1638667, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/magazine/zte-technologies/2017/5/en_733/465604, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://en.corporatenews.com.bd/bangladeshs-first-tier-iv-national-data-center-construction/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201507/20150701030546.shtml , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/magazine/zte-technologies/2017/5/en_733/465604.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://store.todayir.com/todayirattachment_cn/zte/attachment/201703241048061718724185_en.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&news_id=2550200&date=2019-11-29, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-09/19/c_138404802.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/hntoxft6m0orskg/IV%20Tier%20National%20Data%20Center_%20Heart%20of%20Digital%20Bangladesh%202021%20-%20ztetechnologies.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020150119eb1j000pa&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","The Tier IV Data Center is located in the Kaliakair Upazila within Gazipur District and the Division of Dhaka","","","",""

52748,"China Eximbank provides $1.984 billion loan for First Phase of 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID #56005, #38245, #56547, #56402, and #56357)","On June 9, 2014, the Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. (NWPGCL) signed a joint venture agreement with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) to construct the first phase of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Chinese translation:  孟加拉帕亚拉PAYRA2*660MW燃煤电站项目). CMC and NWPGCL formed the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) — a special purpose vehicle — to carry out this project. The Prime Ministers from both countries attended the June 2014 signing ceremony for the BCPCL. NWPGCL and CMC registered BCPCL on October 1, 2014. NWPGCL is a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). BPDP and CMC are both state-owned companies. The total cost of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant is $2.48 billion and it is reportedly being financed according to an 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio. NWPGCL and CMC each reportedly will provide 50% of the equity financing for this project. This project only tracks the debt funding. Project ID #56005 captures the equity funding for this project. China Eximbank covered the remaining 80% of the project through debt financing. On December 29, 2016, the China Eximbank and BCPCL signed a $1.984 billion loan agreement to support the construction of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. This loan reportedly carries the following terms: 19-year maturity, 4 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2% margin (which we estimate as 3.306% at the time of commitment since 1.306% was the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2016). The Government of Bangladesh provided a $1 billion sovereign guarantee for this loan on December 31, 2017. The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see Project ID #55522). Phase one of the project involves the construction of units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW.  In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. The project was officially launched on October 27, 2018. The power plant became operational on January 13, 2020.  A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of the power plant.  Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy.  The project site is located at Latitude: 22⁰ 59' 58"" N and Longitude: 90⁰ 17' 58"" E adjacent to the Kazol River or upstream of Rabnabad Channel at Dhankhali Union, Kalapara Upazila, Patuakhali District of Bangladesh. The site is spread across the Mouza: Modhupara, Char Nisanbaria, and Nisanbaria. The site can be approached by a direct road from the nearby Dhaka – Kuakata Road (highway no. R880). The site is nearby the widely used Londa Kheya Ghat at Kalapara Upazila. Transport of heavy equipment can be made by an adjacent river route. The site is approximately 13 km away from the nearest UpazilaSTAFF_NOTE: Despite news articles that identify the lending terms for the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project as non-concessional, the grant element is 43.52%, so we code it as a concessional loan. We also code the project as having mixed (development and commercial) intent because the power plant is being partially financed via equity contributions (described in Project ID #56005). Other English names for the Payra Coal-fired Power Plant Project include 'Payra Power Hub' and the alternative spellings of “Pyra” and “Paira”.  The Chinese name of the project is ""帕亚拉超临界燃煤电站"" This project should not be confused with any of the joint-development agreements for the Payra 3600 MW LNG-to-Power Project signed by NWPGCL and Siemens (Germany). Also, note that there are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign. These projects include: (1) Bangladesh’s Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748). China Eximbank financing for phase two (units 3 and 4) is currently unspecified, with the most recent details record in Project ID #38245. (2) Bangladesh’s Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China’s China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of  Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the China Eximbank for the debt portion of the project. China Eximbank financing for this project is currently not captured in a stand-alone Project ID#. (3) Bangladesh’s Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and China’s NORINCO, which established a joint venture in November 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of 1320MW (2 x 660MW) MW Patuakhali Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56357.

53584,"China Eximbank provides a $467.8 million preferential buyer's credit for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project ID#38349)","On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh.Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The PBC is captured here, in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured in Project ID#38349. The China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become “effective” until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong.  In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy, and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling began on March 15, 2019. STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for the China Eximbank PBC is L1120171103A.","Industry, Mining, Construction","http://www.bu.edu/cgef/#/2017/Country/Malaysia, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://newsbase.com/topstories/cpp-wins-bangladesh-pipeline-contract, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwto3uv514o4hpr/IJGlobal%20-%20Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Pipeline%20%28220KM%29%20%26%20Single%20Point%20Mooring%20%28SPM%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qqsuu3xdaor87q/Double%20Pipeline%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thefinancetoday.net/article/economy/3113/China-funded-projects-in-slow-lane-on-land-acquisition-delays , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwo1ntsvrck5dsr/Double%20Pipeline%20China%20Eximbank.pdf?dl=0 , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qqsuu3xdaor87q/Double%20Pipeline%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/nr2016/201610/fe65114aadcc4c0ea82f4265e37c2f5a.shtml , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://cpp.cnpc.com.cn/gdjen/newscenter/201903/d3617ec20a2b4f0b879baaea86cbebe7.shtml , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/infrastructure/sluggish-single-point-mooring-construction-eat-more-funds-and-time-39705, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/3a5d097c_651e_4f02_aea7_b94d1f75353a/Press%20Release_English.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.3%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://english.scio.gov.cn/2017-10/30/content_41813152.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/print/chinese-firm-building-single-mooring-at-bay-1563730380 , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwto3uv514o4hpr/IJGlobal%20-%20Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Pipeline%20%28220KM%29%20%26%20Single%20Point%20Mooring%20%28SPM%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0 , Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/b2caf26b_7f39_44e8_9a88_3c0e1eacef6b/PR_English_ASIA.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://ep-bd.com/view/details/article/MzE2NA%3D%3D/title?q=Construction+Work+of+Single-Point+Mooring+at+Moheshkhali+Begins , Other; https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-10/30/content_33886133.htm , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/business/2016-12/08/content_39878937.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.china-embassy.org/chn/dshd/t1506411.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,"Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district","","","",""
39369,"Chinese Government provides RMB 200 million interest-free loan for Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #33929 and #38969)","In 2000, the Chinese Government offered $53.29 million of debt financing to the Government of Bangladesh to build an 800 ton-per-day di-ammonia phosphate fertilizer plant in Chittagong. The total cost of the project was $59.21 million, and the Government of Bangladesh agreed to supply the remaining $6 million. Under a contract signed between China National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation Limited (COMPLANT) and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Chinese Government agreed to provide an RMB 200 million loan for the project. The loan agreement was finalized on September 13, 2000, and it carried the following terms: 20-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 0% interest rate. COMPLANT agreed to provide an additional $29.11 million from a supplier’s credit, which in turn funded with the proceeds from an export seller’s credit that it received (see Project ID#38969). Construction of the di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer plant — known as Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) — was expected to begin at the end of 2000 and projected to commence operations within 30 months. However, the project did not commence until April 2004 and it was not completed until June 2006. In August 2016, an ammonia tank at the plant exploded, causing at least 50 people to fall sick from inhaling toxic gas. The emission of toxic ammonia at the fertilizer factory was brought under control on August 23, 2016, some 11 hours after one of two smaller 500-tonne capacity ammonia storage tanks exploded. Fifty people were admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH). BCIC, which now runs the factory, formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident. Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) is located within the Anowara Upazilla (SubDistrict) of Chittagong Division.

34217,"Chinese Government provides 2 billion taka grant for 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project over the Arial Khan River","“On July 28, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an agreement at the Joint Economic Commission to build the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge. Then, the two governments signed an exchange of letters for the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project on May 14, 2010. The 700 meters long and 13-meter wide bridge runs over the Arial Khan (Arialkha) river along the Dhaka-Barisal highway. It is located in Kazirtek (Kazirtack) within Madaripur District and about 115km far away from the capital Dhaka.  The purpose of constructing the bridge, which is also known locally as Kazirtack Bridge (Bangla translation: কাজিরটেক ব্রীজ), was to ease travel between Dhaka and Barisal. Of the entire bridge construction cost (2,943,014,000 taka), approximately 2,001,183,600 taka was granted by the Chinese Government. Anhui Construction Engineering Group (ACEG) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 1, 2012. Project completion was originally expected on June 30, 2016. However, the project was finished ahead of schedule, and the project handover ceremony was held on August 26, 2015.  Its exact locational coordinates are available at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Asmot+Ali+Khan+Bridge/@23.1697927,90.2329958,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x37556de94d5e9c5f:0xefd0a5ccbaaeeb9d!8m2!3d23.1697878!4d90.2351845STAFF_NOTE: The grant funding for this project is assumed to be separate from the RMB 100 million grant from the Chinese Government— through an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) signed in 2009— that is described in Project ID #53972. The ECTA was signed in December 2009 and Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division indicates that no funding had been disbursed as of 2017, while the Chinese government committed to funding the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge in July 2009 and fully disbursed the funding. Note that the Government of Bangladesh also uses the following titles to describe this project: Asmot Ali Khan Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge over Arial Khan River of Madaripur (Mostafapur)-Shariatpur-Chandpur Road and 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge (Kazirtack Bridge)-Over Arial Khan River with other Three Bridge at Madaripur(Mostafapur)-Shariatpur-Chandpur Road (Madaripur Part).","Transport and Storage","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020090729e57s0001e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020090804e58400008&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rthd.gov.bd/admin/profiles/donation/rthd_10.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.plancomm.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SFYP_Part-2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=99129, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://china.org.cn/world/2012-01/04/content_24321132.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/2009/07/29/74687.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.chineseembassy.org/chn/xwdt/t894751.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.icsin.org/uploads/2015/04/07/3a1f826bfc9c06bd80ae0d2d7372e535.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jef/papers/vol3-issue1/Version-1/B03110919.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://www.bashundharagroup.com/anhui-construction-praises-quality-of-king-brand-cement, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://hkgzaixian.com/enterprise/show/2017-04-24/541.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://yws.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zt_obor/subjecte/201508/20150801089741.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://world.people.com.cn/n1/2017/0509/c1002-29264161.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.china-embassy.org/chn/xwdt/t894751.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://img.imsilkroad.com/a/10001/201805/1526867078710.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jjhzj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/y/201508/20150801095703.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bd2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralcooperation/bilateralagreement/201005/20100506913230.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://cptu.gov.bd/advertisement-goods/details-57707.html , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kazirtack+Bridge+(%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%95+%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%9C),+Madaripur+-+Dhaka+Hwy,+Bangladesh/@23.1836089,90.2387166,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x37556df3082c62b5:0xe7afea44a6976f68!8m2!3d23.183604!4d90.2409053 , Other; http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Project%20Monitoring/SingleProjectDetails.asp?SelectedProjectID=3839 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Project%20Monitoring/SingleProjectDetails.asp?SelectedProjectID=3845 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://web.archive.org/web/20130318014315/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/ND24Df03.html , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.aceg.com.cn/main/model/newinfo/newinfo.do?infoId=21248, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui_Construction_Engineering_Group, Other; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui_Construction_Engineering_Group, Other; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/11/c_136274644.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.people.cn/90883/7695209.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020090729e57s0001e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020090804e58400008&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","23°10'11.3""N 90°14'06.6""E","","","",""
