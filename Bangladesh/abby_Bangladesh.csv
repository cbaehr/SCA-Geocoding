41981,"Chinese Government provides additional RMB 50 million grant for 6th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #33941, #39022)","In 2002, the Chinese Government provided an RMB 50 million grant (Project ID#41981), an RMB 60 million grant (Project ID#33941), and an RMB 50 million interest-free loan (Project ID#39022) for the 6th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Project. These grant and interest-free loan commitments were codified in Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ECTA) that were signed on January 11, 2002, and December 24, 2002. The Jamuna Multi-Purpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) signed a project implementation contract with China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) on December 27, 2004.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 27, 2005. Construction began on April 28, 2005. The 1521 meters long and 10 meters wide bridge was officially opened to traffic on February 18, 2008. Several sources indicate that RMB 141 million of grant funding was ultimately disbursed for the construction of this bridge.The Muktarpur bridge is located over the Dhaleshwari (Dhaleshwari) River, a tributary of the Meghna River, and on Dhaka-Munshigonj road. It is 37 kilometers southeast of Dhaka. The construction of the bridge sought to establish a fixed transport link between Dhaka city and Munshigonj, which is one of the major supply areas of agricultural products to the capital city. The district of Munshigonj, separated by the Dhleshwari river is situated 30 km south of Dhaka. It consists of 6 upazilas, 67 union parishads, 662 mousaz, 906 villages, 18 wards, 73 mahallas, and 2 municipalities.

34070,"Chinese Government provides RMB 710 million grant for Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center Construction Project","On April 24, 2008, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an MoU on the construction of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center in Dhaka.  The Chinese Government pledged to provide 2.1 billion BDT of the estimated 2.75 billion BDT needed for the project. The Chinese Government initially provided an RMB 60 million grant commitment. However, according to the Government of Bangladesh's Economic Affairs Division (EAD), the Chinese Government ultimately committed RMB 710 million for this project.  The Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center is located in Purbachal, a 6,150-acre town in the northeastern suburbs of Dhaka.  The center will be linked with eight-lane expressways from Dhaka's principal Hazrat Shahjalal International Airport road.  The precise locational coordinates of the center are available at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Bangladesh+China+Friendship+Exibition+Center/@23.8426008,90.5324999,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3755cb986eafe535:0x6cd23860a3378f49!8m2!3d23.8425959!4d90.5346886. The center will have about 800 booths of 9 square meters each in two big hall rooms. There will also be a conference room, press center, meeting room, and business information center, as well as parking space for 1,500 cars. The general contractor for the project is China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD) and Shenyang Engineering Supervision & Consultation Corporation (SESCC) are responsible for the supervision of the project and overseeing the construction schedule and quality.  On April 17, 2017, the Bangladeshi authorities officially handed over a land permit to allow construction of the center to proceed. Then, on July 10, 2018, the Government of Bangladesh’s Economic Commission Executive Committee (ECNEC) officially approved a modification to the project. The total cost of the project reportedly increased from 2.75 billion BDT to 7.96 billion BDT, and then again to 10.03 billion BDT.  The expected completion date of the project was November 30, 2019. However, the project has been plagued by delays and controversy and it was still not complete as of mid-2020. The current planned end date is December 2020.  Bangladeshi environmentalists and human rights advocates filed a set of complaints related to the project, alleging that the city Capital City Development Authority (RAJUK) violated a host of environmental regulations and laws by adding the exhibit hall as part of a set of changes to the township’s overall design. The High Court and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, in separate orders, declared the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center illegal. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a decision instructing RAJUK “not to efface, subtract, vary, modify or otherwise change the core forest, forest, lakes or canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds, play lots, green belt and other environmental-oriented spaces of the project without any permission of the court.” However, RAJUK and CSCEC continued the construction of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center in potential violation of the law. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 加拉国孟中友谊展览中心项目.","Trade and Tourism","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020070723e37m0003f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

56402,"China Eximbank provides $1.75 billion loan for 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID #56005, #52748, #38245, #56357, and #56547)","In 2017, China Eximbank provide a loan worth approximately $1.75 billion to RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) for the construction of the Patuakhali 1320 (2 x 600) MW Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. RNPL is a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) created by Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and NORINCO Intl. in 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of this power plant. RPCL is a Bangladeshi state-owned electrification enterprise and NORINCO Intl. is a Chinese state-owned arms manufacturing company. The two state-owned enterprises registered their venture, RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) with the Government of Bangladesh’s Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms on December 27, 2017. The total cost of the project is approximately $2.5 billion. It is reportedly being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. RPCL and NORINCO each hold 50% equity shares in the project company. At the time of creation, RNPL had 200,000,000 BDT, with a maximum authorized capital of 400,000,000 BDT. The value of the Chinese equity funding is unclear. Since NORINCO held 50% of RNPL’s equity, the NORINCO funding may equal 100,000,000 BDT (approximately 1.2 million USD in December 2017). However, since the total project cost is 2.5 billion USD, and NORINCO owns half of the 30% equity share in the project company, NORINCO’s equity contribution could be as high as 15% of $2.5 billion, or $375 million USD. To avoid inaccurately representing the value of this investment, no transaction amount is recorded for the equity portion of this project for the time being (reported in Project ID #56357). China Eximbank is providing the debt financing for this project. Its loan to RNPL reportedly carries a 4% interest rate, 5 year grace period, and 20-year maturity. Project ID#56402 only captures the debt financing that came from the China Eximbank loan. The precise face value of the China Eximbank loan is unknown. However, RNPL has stated that the total project cost is $2.5 billion and that 70% of the funding would come from the China Eximbank loan, which implies a  value of $1.75 billion. During the implementation of the 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project, RNPL will construct a coal jetty, coal import-handling facilities, coal storage, the power plant, transmission facilities, roads, and the town surrounding the plant. The project will process 12273 tons of coal per day and sell power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). This power plant will operate on 915.74 acres of land. The plant will displace 350 families, so RPCL will set up a village with schools, shops, community centers, and mosques. On March 6, 2019, RNPL signed an EPC contract with NORINCO International Cooperation Ltd. and it issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to the EPC contractor on August 31, 2019. China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd., Central Southern China Electric Power, and the Design Institute of China Power Engineering Consulting Group Corporation are also involved in the design and implementation of the project. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of this project is 孟加拉博杜阿卡利1320MW燃煤电站项目建设 or Patuakhali 2台66万千瓦燃煤电站业主工程师咨询服务项目. The exact commitment date of the China Eximbank loan for this project is unknown. However, the RPCL Managing Director announced the loan terms in November 2017, the same month the two firms signed the joint venture agreement, making 2017 the likely year in which the loan agreement was finalized.There are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign.These projects include: (1) Bangladesh’s Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748). China Eximbank financing for phase two (units 3 and 4) is currently unspecified, with the most recent details record in Project ID #38245. (2) Bangladesh’s Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China’s China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of  Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the China Eximbank for the debt portion of the project. China Eximbank financing for this project is currently not captured in a stand-alone Project ID#. (3) Bangladesh’s Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and China’s NORINCO, which established a joint venture in November 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of 1320MW (2 x 660MW) MW Patuakhali Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant.

56541,"China Eximbank and Bank of China provide $119.4 million syndicated loan for 220MW Surajganj 2 Combined Cycle Dual Fuel Power Project (linked to #69033)","On October 10, 2015, China Eximbank and Bank of China signed a $119.4 million syndicated loan agreement with North-West Power Generation Company Limited for Unit 2 of the 220MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (also known as the Sirajganj 2 Project). Northwest Power Generation Company Limited is a state-owned power and electric company in Bangladesh. It is a 100% subsidiary of Bangladesh Power Development Board. The loan reportedly carries a 15-year maturity. It is insured by Sinosure and it received a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Bangladesh. The proceeds of the loan are to be used to finance part of the costs of goods and services under a turnkey EPC contract (signed on August 20, 2014) with China Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) and Fujian Electric Power Survey & Design Institute (FEDI). $68.9 million in additional financing for the project followed in December 2015 when MIGA committed to a guarantee for the non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations against loans from Standard Chartered ($44 million) and Siemens Bank ($24.9 million). CMC is the consortium leader and will provide overall project management while FEDI will provide technical expertise, including concept design and basic engineering. The turbines will be supplied by Siemens AG (Germany). The same EPC team (CMC, FEDI, Siemens) was responsible for the construction, commissioning, and early operation of the first unit of electricity generators (“Sirajganj 1”). The Sirajganj 220MW Combined Cycle Power Plant is a major project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It involves the installation of 3 units of electricity generators, each of 225MW capacity. It is an expansion of the existing 150MW power plant on the Jamunja river. The proceeds of the 2015 syndicated loan from the Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China only supported the installation of the second unit of electricity generators (“Sirajganj 2”, which passed the final inspection tests in February 2018. The second unit of the power plant began commercial operations on February 5, 2018.  The project involved the construction, installation, and operation of a 225 MW dual-fuel CCPP (similar to Sirajganj 1) within the Sirajganj Power Complex, comprising a dual-fuel gas turbine, generator, steam turbine and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), water treatment and cooling system, as well as the construction of a 230 kV switchyard and an extension of the existing 230 kV switching station within the Sirajganj Power Complex. The project utilized the existing jetty for unloading heavy equipment, access roads, and water treatment and cooling systems that were constructed for Sirajganj 1. The project is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 130 km north-west of Dhaka. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul & Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the power plant complex. Natural gas, the main fuel for the project, will be supplied by Petrobangla, and there are already existing pipelines servicing the power plant complex for the Sirajganj 1 Project. Power from the project will be evacuated to the national grid through the existing 230kV switching station beside the project site.
