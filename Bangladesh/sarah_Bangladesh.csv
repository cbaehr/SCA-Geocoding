Bank of Communications reportedly contributed a $50 million export buyer's credit to this loan syndicate. The loan reportedly has a 12-year maturity, a two-year grace period, and a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Bangladesh. The loan covers 100% of the EPC costs and comes with full ECA cover from Finnvera and Sinosure. Associated costs and expenses have been financed under an uncovered facility. Finnvera is covering a total of $46.9 million with Sinosure guaranteeing the remainder. Both guarantees effectively reinsure a 100% sovereign guarantee from the Bangladeshi government, which owns BPDB. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation was the accountable party of the credit agreement. The proceeds of the loan are being used to finance the EPC contract and turbine procurement from Hubei Electric Power Survey and Design Institute and Wartsila Finland. The $131 million project is sponsored by Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and it involves around $47 million for 12 Wartsila 20V32 heavy fuel oil engines, with the remainder covering EPC costs generated by Hubei Electric Power Survey and Design Institute, which is building the plant under a 450-day turnkey EPC contract and is providing a two-year warranty and a four-year service and maintenance contract. Although the plant came with a relatively high generation cost (Tk21.70 per kilowatt-hour [kWh] as compared with between Tk6.0 and Tk18 per kWh for other Bangladeshi HFO plants), the project has significant political backing as it is part of Bangladesh’s Power System Master Plan 2010 and will help improve the overall electricity supply to export processing zones that have been established in the north-west of the country. Implementation of this project began in May of 2015.

34237,"ICBC provides $224 million buyer’s credit loan for 3rd Phase of Barapukuria Power Station Project (Linked to Project ID#52735 and ID#33957)","In January 2014, ICBC provided $224 million buyer’s credit to a joint venture of Harbin Electic International Co., Ltd. and CCC Engineering Ltd to increase the capacity of the 250MW Barapukuria coal-fired thermal power station by 275 MW, the third phase of the expansion project. The remainder of the estimated cost of the $330.52 million project was to be funded by the Government of Bangladesh. The buyer’s credit reportedly carried an interest rate of 3.99% a maturity of 13 years, a management fee of 1.5%, an insurance premium of 6.62%, and a commitment fee of 1%. The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for this buyer's credit on February 16, 2015.  Harbin Electric International and CCC Engineering China were the contractors responsible for project implementation. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/40466.As of August 2, 2016, 40 percent of the power plant project was complete. The power plant was connected to the power grid on November 10, 2017,  Harbin Electric International and CCC Engineering China originally expected to complete the project in June 2018. However, the project was finished ahead of schedule on May 27, 2018.On July 22, 2018, the Barapukuria coal-fired power plant was shut down after the discovery of the “Barapukuria coal scam”, which was a corruption scandal concerning the misappropriation of around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion by officials of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) from the coal mine of Barapukuria, Dinajpur District, in northern Bangladesh. The scandal was revealed in July 2018 when a board member of the Bangladesh Power Development Board went to visit the coal mine and found no fresh coal whereas according to the document there should have been around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal reserved. The matter came to light when a Bangladeshi English-language daily reported the incident. Petrobangla, the parent organization of the BCMCL, promptly suspended a few officials in this connection while the Anti-Corruption Commission started an inquiry to trace the corruption. Barapukuria's coal-fired power plant suspended its operations due to the shortage of coal as an immediate effect of the corruption scandal. Before the shutdown of the plant, it had been supplying around 380MW power to the national grid on an average. When the power plant shut down the first time, the people of eight northern districts of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions suffered from a lack of electricity.  BPDB then decided to restart one of its units for five days on August 20, 2018. On August 28, 2018, the plant shut down again. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 巴库275MW火电项目是哈电国际公司继孟加拉同吉和西莱特.","Energy Generation and Supply","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCSAP0020090727e57r001b9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://english.thereport24.com/article/1776/index.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2014/05/27/36245/print, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://newagebd.net/39481/govt-set-to-take-1-5b-in-loans-on-hard-terms/#sthash.fz9XLREo.3XIRsbqK.dpbs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/index.php?ref=MjBfMDZfMjhfMTNfMV8xXzE3NDQ5NA==, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://d30fl32nd2baj9.cloudfront.net/media/2016/06/02/loans-advances-and-other-non-development-expenditure-eng.pdf/BINARY/Loans+%26+Advances+and+Other+Non-Development+Expenditure+eng.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/20230, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/power-energy/2017/02/14/feasibility-study-deal-expansion-barapukuria-coal-mine-feb-16/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://businessnews24bd.com/barapukuria-thermal-power-plant40-pc-works-of-3rd-unit-complrted/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://mof.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/mof.portal.gov.bd/page/e9e8a8c8_8a8b_4536_a18b_fc5ca696650a/St_6a1_en.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.china-hei.com/en.php/News/news_3_view/id/2195, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.china-hei.com/en.php/News/news_1_view/id/1910 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://en.harbin-electric.com/index.php?g=&m=News&a=news&id=83, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://bdnews24.com/economy/2014/01/26/govt-okays-2-power-projects, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thedailystar.net/power-plant-credit-set-for-further-talks-24726?amp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://energybangla.com/hard-term-loan-3-power-plants/ , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dhakatribune.com/bangladesh/development/2017/12/03/national-grid-barapukuria-power , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://envnews.org/news/75167.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barapukuria_Power_Station , Other; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barapukuria_coal_scam, Other; https://www.gem.wiki/Barapukuria_Coal_Power_Plant, Other; http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/40466 , Other; https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/barapukuria-coal-fired-power-plant-unit-iii/18c901d8-49fa-48e6-966d-fffb221a522f/ , NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.thedailystar.net/business/barapukuria-coal-power-plant-adds-another-unit-159229, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://malaysia.icbc.com.cn/icbc/%E5%B7%A5%E8%A1%8C%E9%A3%8E%E8%B2%8C/%E5%AA%92%E4%BD%93%E7%9C%8B%E5%B7%A5%E8%A1%8C/%E9%87%91%E8%9E%8D%E6%97%B6%E6%8A%A5%E5%B7%A5%E8%A1%8C13%E4%BA%BF%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%E8%9E%8D%E8%B5%84%E6%94%AF%E6%8C%81%E5%AD%9F%E5%8A%A0%E6%8B%89%E4%B8%80%E5%B8%A6%E4%B8%80%E8%B7%AF%E9%A1%B9%E7%9B%AE.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://hlj.sina.com.cn/news/b/2018-05-30/detail-ihcffhsv3796733.shtml , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://mof.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/mof.portal.gov.bd/page/e9e8a8c8_8a8b_4536_a18b_fc5ca696650a/St_6a1_en.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCSAP0020090727e57r001b9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","This power plant is located in Phulbari and Parbatipur upazila within Dinajpur district and Rangpur district.","","","",""

The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. According to a 2016 ODA report from the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Government of Bangladesh, RMB 767.325 million had been disbursed through the China Eximbank GCL by 2017.  Phase II of the Info-Sarker Project, which is also known as the Development of National ICT Infra-Network for Bangladesh Government Phase II Project, sought to consolidate and link all Bangladeshi government offices — at both district and sub-district levels — under a single network. It was an extension of the BanglaGovNet project implemented by the Bangladesh Computer Council whereby all ministries/divisions, major departments, deputy commissioner’s offices, and upazillas were to be connected under an ICT Backbone Network. Phase II of the project involved significant improvements in the Bangladesh Government’s efficiency, transparency, effectiveness, and quality of services through the expansion of the network and other facilities established in Phase I of the BanglaGovNet project. China Machinery and Equipment Engineering Co., Ltd. and Huawei serve as the general contractor and major subcontractor for this project, respectively. This project, which was completed on or around March 4, 2016, ultimately brought 18,130 government offices at the district and sub-district levels under an ICT network, paving the way for the prime minister's office and other ministries and departments in Dhaka to establish direct communications around the country. 800 video conferencing systems were also installed at different offices, including the ministries, government departments, and training centers. Additionally, a disaster recovery center was established and a training center for developing ICT capabilities was established at the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC). STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for this China Eximbank GCL is L1120130531a. The project is sometimes also referred to as Phase II Project of Bangladesh National Infrastructure Network. China Eximbank also financed Phase III of the Info-Sarker Project (see Project ID#38335).","Government and Civil Society","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020130314e93e000jh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mof.gov.bd/en/budget/13_14/cdg/en/28_ict_en.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/china/2013-03/13/c_132231422.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&news_id=2349667&date=2013-07-03, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.bssnews.net/newsDetails.php?cat=0&id=462774&date=2015-01-15, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.google.com.sg/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CBwQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fkaliganj.satkhira.gov.bd%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fkaliganj.satkhira.gov.bd%2FDevelopment%2520of%2520National%2520ICT%2520Infr1.docx&ei=mTqaVaytKoa8ugSHhYHACA&usg=AFQjCNFUdq6ioY4VS_j6hOW9Se3v5GmSvw&sig2=6TIZ8OPs9szQLiD3_BchLA&bvm=bv.96952980,d.c2E, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://news.xinhuanet.com/2013-03/13/c_115015566.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://finance.china.com.cn/roll/20160609/3760471.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://money.163.com/13/0313/21/8PSJPDV600253B0H.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.2%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bcc.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/bcc.portal.gov.bd/page/ecbb5603_1eac_4bf0_99fe_628e9980c279/e-Government%20Masterplan%20for%20Digital%20Bangladesh_V6.0%20(2).pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/e192dd17_a4f0_4592_bda8_3b981898f9a0/Annex-11_Wing8.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://bcc.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/bcc.portal.gov.bd/page/fe563588_44c4_4730_af26_ad4151fba82c/1.%20Introduction.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.theindependentbd.com/arcprint/details/36040/2016-03-04 , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201712/14/WS5a320af7a3108bc8c6734ad9.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/world/Off_the_Wire/2016-06/09/content_38631949.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://chinamachinery.todayir.com/attachment/20130531181701001663336_en.pdf , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=BBCAPP0020130314e93e000jh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,"","","",""
