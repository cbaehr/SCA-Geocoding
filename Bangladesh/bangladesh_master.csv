41981,"Chinese Government provides additional RMB 50 million grant for 6th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #33941, #39022)","In 2002, the Chinese Government provided an RMB 50 million grant (Project ID#41981), an RMB 60 million grant (Project ID#33941), and an RMB 50 million interest-free loan (Project ID#39022) for the 6th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Project. These grant and interest-free loan commitments were codified in Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ECTA) that were signed on January 11, 2002, and December 24, 2002. The Jamuna Multi-Purpose Bridge Authority (JMBA) signed a project implementation contract with China Road & Bridge Corporation (CRBC) on December 27, 2004.  A groundbreaking ceremony took place on January 27, 2005. Construction began on April 28, 2005. The 1521 meters long and 10 meters wide bridge was officially opened to traffic on February 18, 2008. Several sources indicate that RMB 141 million of grant funding was ultimately disbursed for the construction of this bridge.The Muktarpur bridge is located over the Dhaleshwari (Dhaleshwari) River, a tributary of the Meghna River, and on Dhaka-Munshigonj road. It is 37 kilometers southeast of Dhaka. The construction of the bridge sought to establish a fixed transport link between Dhaka city and Munshigonj, which is one of the major supply areas of agricultural products to the capital city. The district of Munshigonj, separated by the Dhleshwari river is situated 30 km south of Dhaka. It consists of 6 upazilas, 67 union parishads, 662 mousaz, 906 villages, 18 wards, 73 mahallas, and 2 municipalities.

The general contractor for the project is China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). Beijing Institute of Architectural Design (BIAD) and Shenyang Engineering Supervision & Consultation Corporation (SESCC) are responsible for the supervision of the project and overseeing the construction schedule and quality.  On April 17, 2017, the Bangladeshi authorities officially handed over a land permit to allow construction of the center to proceed. Then, on July 10, 2018, the Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs Economic Commission Executive Committee (ECNEC) officially approved a modification to the project. The total cost of the project reportedly increased from 2.75 billion BDT to 7.96 billion BDT, and then again to 10.03 billion BDT.  The expected completion date of the project was November 30, 2019. However, the project has been plagued by delays and controversy and it was still not complete as of mid-2020. The current planned end date is December 2020.  Bangladeshi environmentalists and human rights advocates filed a set of complaints related to the project, alleging that the city Capital City Development Authority (RAJUK) violated a host of environmental regulations and laws by adding the exhibit hall as part of a set of changes to the township‚Äôs overall design. The High Court and the Appellate Division of the Supreme Court, in separate orders, declared the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center illegal. In March 2014, the Supreme Court issued a decision instructing RAJUK ‚Äúnot to efface, subtract, vary, modify or otherwise change the core forest, forest, lakes or canals, urban green, parks, playgrounds, play lots, green belt and other environmental-oriented spaces of the project without any permission of the court.‚Äù However, RAJUK and CSCEC continued the construction of the Bangladesh-China Friendship Exhibition Center in potential violation of the law. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is Âä†ÊãâÂõΩÂ≠ü‰∏≠ÂèãË∞äÂ±ïËßà‰∏≠ÂøÉÈ°πÁõÆ.",Trade and Tourism,"https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020070723e37m0003f&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

50061,ICBC and China Eximbank provide $231.3 million for 330MW Shahjibazar Power Plant Project,"In June 2014, the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) signed a 13-year $257 million export credit agreement with a syndicated of banks in support of the 330 megawatt Shahjibazar Power Plant Project, which is located in Habiganj, Sylhet, Northeast of Bangladesh. In May 2013, Guangdong Power Engineering Corporation (GPEC) and the Guangdong Electric Power Design Institute (GEDI) of China Energy Engineering Group signed a Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract for this project. The British-based HSBC, China Eximbank, and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) formed a bank syndicated to fund 95% of the cost of the project. ICBC reportedly covered 55% of the cost, while China Eximbank and HSBC covered 35% and 10% of the cost, respectively. This record only reports the 90% of the $257 million ($231.3 million) that came from Chinese financiers. Sinosure provided insurance for this loan.

56402,"China Eximbank provides $1.75 billion loan for 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID #56005, #52748, #38245, #56357, and #56547)","In 2017, China Eximbank provide a loan worth approximately $1.75 billion to RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) for the construction of the Patuakhali 1320 (2 x 600) MW Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. RNPL is a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) created by Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and NORINCO Intl. in 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of this power plant. RPCL is a Bangladeshi state-owned electrification enterprise and NORINCO Intl. is a Chinese state-owned arms manufacturing company. The two state-owned enterprises registered their venture, RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) with the Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms on December 27, 2017. The total cost of the project is approximately $2.5 billion. It is reportedly being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. RPCL and NORINCO each hold 50% equity shares in the project company. At the time of creation, RNPL had 200,000,000 BDT, with a maximum authorized capital of 400,000,000 BDT. The value of the Chinese equity funding is unclear. Since NORINCO held 50% of RNPL‚Äôs equity, the NORINCO funding may equal 100,000,000 BDT (approximately 1.2 million USD in December 2017). However, since the total project cost is 2.5 billion USD, and NORINCO owns half of the 30% equity share in the project company, NORINCO‚Äôs equity contribution could be as high as 15% of $2.5 billion, or $375 million USD. To avoid inaccurately representing the value of this investment, no transaction amount is recorded for the equity portion of this project for the time being (reported in Project ID #56357). China Eximbank is providing the debt financing for this project. Its loan to RNPL reportedly carries a 4% interest rate, 5 year grace period, and 20-year maturity. Project ID#56402 only captures the debt financing that came from the China Eximbank loan. The precise face value of the China Eximbank loan is unknown. However, RNPL has stated that the total project cost is $2.5 billion and that 70% of the funding would come from the China Eximbank loan, which implies a  value of $1.75 billion. During the implementation of the 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project, RNPL will construct a coal jetty, coal import-handling facilities, coal storage, the power plant, transmission facilities, roads, and the town surrounding the plant. The project will process 12273 tons of coal per day and sell power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). This power plant will operate on 915.74 acres of land. The plant will displace 350 families, so RPCL will set up a village with schools, shops, community centers, and mosques. On March 6, 2019, RNPL signed an EPC contract with NORINCO International Cooperation Ltd. and it issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to the EPC contractor on August 31, 2019. China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd., Central Southern China Electric Power, and the Design Institute of China Power Engineering Consulting Group Corporation are also involved in the design and implementation of the project. STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of this project is Â≠üÂä†ÊãâÂçöÊùúÈòøÂç°Âà©1320MWÁáÉÁÖ§ÁîµÁ´ôÈ°πÁõÆÂª∫ËÆæ or Patuakhali 2Âè∞66‰∏áÂçÉÁì¶ÁáÉÁÖ§ÁîµÁ´ô‰∏ö‰∏ªÂ∑•Á®ãÂ∏àÂí®ËØ¢ÊúçÂä°È°πÁõÆ. The exact commitment date of the China Eximbank loan for this project is unknown. However, the RPCL Managing Director announced the loan terms in November 2017, the same month the two firms signed the joint venture agreement, making 2017 the likely year in which the loan agreement was finalized.There are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign.These projects include: (1) Bangladesh‚Äôs Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748). China Eximbank financing for phase two (units 3 and 4) is currently unspecified, with the most recent details record in Project ID #38245. (2) Bangladesh‚Äôs Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China‚Äôs China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of  Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the China Eximbank for the debt portion of the project. China Eximbank financing for this project is currently not captured in a stand-alone Project ID#. (3) Bangladesh‚Äôs Rural Power Company Ltd.

56541,China Eximbank and Bank of China provide $119.4 million syndicated loan for 220MW Surajganj 2 Combined Cycle Dual Fuel Power Project (linked to #69033),"On October 10, 2015, China Eximbank and Bank of China signed a $119.4 million syndicated loan agreement with North-West Power Generation Company Limited for Unit 2 of the 220MW Sirajganj Combined Cycle Power Plant Project (also known as the Sirajganj 2 Project). Northwest Power Generation Company Limited is a state-owned power and electric company in Bangladesh. It is a 100% subsidiary of Bangladesh Power Development Board. The loan reportedly carries a 15-year maturity. It is insured by Sinosure and it received a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Bangladesh. The proceeds of the loan are to be used to finance part of the costs of goods and services under a turnkey EPC contract (signed on August 20, 2014) with China Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) and Fujian Electric Power Survey & Design Institute (FEDI). $68.9 million in additional financing for the project followed in December 2015 when MIGA committed to a guarantee for the non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations against loans from Standard Chartered ($44 million) and Siemens Bank ($24.9 million). CMC is the consortium leader and will provide overall project management while FEDI will provide technical expertise, including concept design and basic engineering. The turbines will be supplied by Siemens AG (Germany). The same EPC team (CMC, FEDI, Siemens) was responsible for the construction, commissioning, and early operation of the first unit of electricity generators (‚ÄúSirajganj 1‚Äù). The Sirajganj 220MW Combined Cycle Power Plant is a major project under the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). It involves the installation of 3 units of electricity generators, each of 225MW capacity. It is an expansion of the existing 150MW power plant on the Jamunja river. The proceeds of the 2015 syndicated loan from the Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China only supported the installation of the second unit of electricity generators (‚ÄúSirajganj 2‚Äù, which passed the final inspection tests in February 2018. The second unit of the power plant began commercial operations on February 5, 2018.  The project involved the construction, installation, and operation of a 225 MW dual-fuel CCPP (similar to Sirajganj 1) within the Sirajganj Power Complex, comprising a dual-fuel gas turbine, generator, steam turbine and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), water treatment and cooling system, as well as the construction of a 230 kV switchyard and an extension of the existing 230 kV switching station within the Sirajganj Power Complex. The project utilized the existing jetty for unloading heavy equipment, access roads, and water treatment and cooling systems that were constructed for Sirajganj 1. The project is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 130 km north-west of Dhaka. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul & Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the power plant complex. Natural gas, the main fuel for the project, will be supplied by Petrobangla, and there are already existing pipelines servicing the power plant complex for the Sirajganj 1 Project. Power from the project will be evacuated to the national grid through the existing 230kV switching station beside the project site.

However, the pipeline project encountered various delays. On December 27, 2010, Teletalk and CMEC signed a contract for the Bangladesh 2.5G Network Expansion and 3G New Construction Project with a total contract value of $216 million. Then, on June 9, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a $211 million loan agreement for the 3G Technology and Expansion of 2.5G Network Project.  The loan carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 19-year maturity, 4 year grace period, and 0.2% commitment fee. The Government of Bangladesh's loan identification number for the China Eximbank GCL is B1120110609a. Teletalk‚Äôs CMEC contract became effective June 9, 2011, and construction officially commenced on January 6, 2012. Then, on October 15, 2012, Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina inaugurated the 3G network. As of 2015, this project was completed and Teletalk reportedly saw significant increases in revenues and subscribers. STAFF_NOTE: This project is also known as the ""Modernization and Expansion of Teletalk's 2G/3G Network of to Rural Areas (MEP).",Communications,"https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060928e29s001hu&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XHELEN0020061008e2a80000h&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mofa.gov.bd/List.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=121913, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/english/international/182597.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralcooperation/bilateralagreement/200705/20070504675633.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020110609e769003v1&pp=1&fcpil=zhcn&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PMPLUN0020100622e66m000s9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.teletalk.com.bd/highlights/net3g.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=121913, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/sci/2012-10/14/c_131905686.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020100115e61f00018&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/sci/2012-10/14/c_131905686.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020111010e7ab00062&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://news.xinhuanet.com/fortune/2012-10/14/c_113364783.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sasac.gov.cn/n1180/n1226/n2410/n314289/14951099.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://ieexpo.com/a/jbh/detail/15366, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jef/papers/vol3-issue1/Version-1/B03110919.pdf, Academic Journal Article; https://www.dropbox.com/s/mjtkodex681kmip/211%20million%20China%20Eximbank%20Loan%20for%20Introduction%20of%203G%20Technology%20%26%20Expansion%20of%202.5G%20Network%20.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/kb5z0dq9gq64qme/Expansion%20of%202G%20and%203G%20Network%20to%20Rural%20Areas.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.telecomengine.com/bangladesh-launches-3g-services/, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://www.sinomach.com.cn/en/MediaCenter/News/201412/t20141209_22000.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.teletalk.com.bd/teletalk/generalFiles/ex_leave/China%20Tour%20of%20MD%20TBL.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.3%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cmec.com/xwzx/mtbd/201501/t20150129_129519.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.sinomach.com.cn/en/MediaCenter/Magazine/201412/P020150116447463076145.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.observerbd.com/2015/11/28/123235.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.facebook.com/notes/teletalk-live/introduction-of-3g-technology-and-expansion-of-teletalk-network/144832778909821?comment_id=1251127&offset=0&total_comments=25 , Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=LBA0000020060928e29s001hu&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XHELEN0020061008e2a80000h&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=XNEWS00020110609e769003v1&pp=1&fcpil=zhcn&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PMPLUN0020100622e66m000s9&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=WDAN000020100115e61f00018&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020111010e7ab00062&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,,,,3G improvements meant to benefit broad groups,good code up,,country

These grant and interest-free loan commitments were codified in Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreements (ECTA) that were signed on January 11, 2002, and December 24, 2002.  The Muktarpur bridge is located over the Dhaleshwari (Dhaleshwari) River, a tributary of the Meghna River, and on Dhaka-Munshigonj road. It is 37 kilometers southeast of Dhaka. The construction of the bridge sought to establish a fixed transport link between Dhaka city and Munshigonj, which is one of the major supply areas of agricultural products to the capital city. The district of Munshigonj, separated by the Dhleshwari river is situated 30 km south of Dhaka. It consists of 6 upazilas, 67 union parishads, 662 mousaz, 906 villages, 18 wards, 73 mahallas and 2 municipalities.

38349,China Eximbank provides RMB 569.6 million government concessional loan for Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project #53584),"On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.The PBC is captured in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured here, in Project ID#38349. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‚Äúeffective‚Äù until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong.  In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy, and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling began on March 15, 2019.STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for the China Eximbank GCL is L1120171103B","Industry, Mining, Construction","http://bd2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralcooperation/bilateralagreement/201005/20100506913230.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.observerbd.com/2015/03/01/75302.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.erl.com.bd/spm.php, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://newagebd.net/44171/dhaka-sends-revised-list-of-15-projects-involving-10b-for-chinese-assistance/#sthash.q474dHAb.dpbs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.daily-sun.com/details_Chinese-firm-wants-to-invest-$325m-at-5.1pc-interest-rate_347_1_3_1_2.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thedailystar.net/bangladesh-china-joint-statement-28234, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://newagebd.net/94791/china-agrees-to-invest-in-10-large-infrastructure-projects/#sthash.Bba7bftV.dpbs, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/2015/03/12/84627/print, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:AjcC1Ypmbm0J:bbs.tianya.cn/post-worldlook-1358272-1.shtml+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=sg, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201508/20150801077609.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwo1ntsvrck5dsr/Double%20Pipeline%20China%20Eximbank.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.3%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://dailyasianage.com/news/197337/chinese-loans--losing-shine, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.2%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwto3uv514o4hpr/IJGlobal%20-%20Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Pipeline%20%28220KM%29%20%26%20Single%20Point%20Mooring%20%28SPM%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf? dl=0 , Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/3a5d097c_651e_4f02_aea7_b94d1f75353a/Press%20Release_English.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://ep-bd.com/view/details/article/MzE2NA%3D%3D/title?q=Construction+Work+of+Single-Point+Mooring+at+Moheshkhali+Begins, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://english.scio.gov.cn/2017-10/30/content_41813152.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/print/chinese-firm-building-single-mooring-at-bay-1563730380 , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-10/30/content_33886133.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpp.cnpc.com.cn/gdjen/newscenter/201903/d3617ec20a2b4f0b879baaea86cbebe7.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qqsuu3xdaor87q/Double%20Pipeline%20Project.pdf?dl=0 and https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/infrastructure/sluggish-single-point-mooring-construction-eat-more-funds-and-time-39705, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thefinancetoday.net/article/economy/3113/China-funded-projects-in-slow-lane-on-land-acquisition-delays , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/business/2016-12/08/content_39878937.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.china-embassy.org/chn/dshd/t1506411.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/nr2016/201610/fe65114aadcc4c0ea82f4265e37c2f5a.shtml , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/b2caf26b_7f39_44e8_9a88_3c0e1eacef6b/PR_English_ASIA.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient)",NA,"Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district",,,,Location in location_details,good,https://gist.github.com/cbaehr/d59d0a69efd50ab0870969c5880473d1,district
52654,"China Eximbank provides RMB 945,551,000 government concessional loan for construction of IV Tier National Data Center Project in Kaliakoir","On April 15, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 945,551,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Tier IV National Data Center Project in Kaliakoir. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for this China Eximbank GCL is L1120160415A. The purpose of this project was to build a flagship Tier IV Data Center in the Kaliakair Upazila within Gazipur District and the Division of Dhaka to store and process a large amount of official data. ZTE was the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC). As of 2017, the data center had been constructed, but the operational status of the data center was delayed by U.S. government sanctions on ZTE. In October 2018, the data center underwent operational tests. The project was officially completed on November 29, 2019. The Bangladesh National Data Center (NDC) is the first national data center that received both the UPTIME Tier IV design certification and facility certification in the country and is also the first data center in South Asia that got UPTIME Tier IV facility certification. In addition, the data center passed all the test items of the Uptime Tier IV construction certification, thereby being highly appraised by the Uptime Institute. During the construction of the data center, the ZTE construction team overcame a series of challenges, such as inconvenient transportation, unstable power supply, and bad weather.",Communications,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020150119eb1j000pa&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201607/20160701361505.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/most-advanced-data-centre-set-test-run-1638667, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/first-page/countrys-digital-infrastructure-boasts-tier-4-data-centre-1518802284, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thedailystar.net/business/national-data-centre-be-ready-2017-1302760, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/site/page/dbc55067-77ac-4d2d-a2a2-a7b348ff20de/Commitment-FY-2015-16, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/4okrart8vv5yqo6/IJGlobal%20-%20Tier%204%20National%20Data%20Centre%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://ictd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/ictd.portal.gov.bd/notices/47615f01_c7f9_470a_9e8c_2b367b3d124f/GO%20China.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.thedailystar.net/business/news/most-advanced-data-centre-set-test-run-1638667, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/magazine/zte-technologies/2017/5/en_733/465604, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://en.corporatenews.com.bd/bangladeshs-first-tier-iv-national-data-center-construction/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201507/20150701030546.shtml , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.zte.com.cn/global/about/magazine/zte-technologies/2017/5/en_733/465604.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://store.todayir.com/todayirattachment_cn/zte/attachment/201703241048061718724185_en.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.newstoday.com.bd/index.php?option=details&news_id=2550200&date=2019-11-29, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2019-09/19/c_138404802.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/hntoxft6m0orskg/IV%20Tier%20National%20Data%20Center_%20Heart%20of%20Digital%20Bangladesh%202021%20-%20ztetechnologies.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=FNEXBD0020150119eb1j000pa&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",The Tier IV Data Center is located in the Kaliakair Upazila within Gazipur District and the Division of Dhaka,,,,Location in location_details,good,https://gist.github.com/cbaehr/1f870f7550dfea573475f1b08b22e33d,district

52748,"China Eximbank provides $1.984 billion loan for First Phase of 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID #56005, #38245, #56547, #56402, and #56357)","On June 9, 2014, the Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. (NWPGCL) signed a joint venture agreement with China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation (CMC) to construct the first phase of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project (Chinese translation:  Â≠üÂä†ÊãâÂ∏ï‰∫öÊãâPAYRA2*660MWÁáÉÁÖ§ÁîµÁ´ôÈ°πÁõÆ). CMC and NWPGCL formed the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) ‚Äî a special purpose vehicle ‚Äî to carry out this project. The Prime Ministers from both countries attended the June 2014 signing ceremony for the BCPCL. NWPGCL and CMC registered BCPCL on October 1, 2014. 

NWPGCL is a subsidiary of the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). BPDP and CMC are both state-owned companies. The total cost of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant is $2.48 billion and it is reportedly being financed according to an 80:20 debt-to-equity ratio. NWPGCL and CMC each reportedly will provide 50% of the equity financing for this project. This project only tracks the debt funding. Project ID #56005 captures the equity funding for this project. China Eximbank covered the remaining 80% of the project through debt financing. On December 29, 2016, the China Eximbank and BCPCL signed a $1.984 billion loan agreement to support the construction of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. This loan reportedly carries the following terms: 19-year maturity, 4 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2% margin (which we estimate as 3.306% at the time of commitment since 1.306% was the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2016). The Government of Bangladesh provided a $1 billion sovereign guarantee for this loan on December 31, 2017. 

The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see Project ID #55522). Phase one of the project involves the construction of units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW.  In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. The project was officially launched on October 27, 2018. The power plant became operational on January 13, 2020.  A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of the power plant.  Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy.  

The project site is located at Latitude: 22‚Å∞ 59' 58"" N and Longitude: 90‚Å∞ 17' 58"" E adjacent to the Kazol River or upstream of Rabnabad Channel at Dhankhali Union, Kalapara Upazila, Patuakhali District of Bangladesh. The site is spread across the Mouza: Modhupara, Char Nisanbaria, and Nisanbaria. The site can be approached by a direct road from the nearby Dhaka ‚Äì Kuakata Road (highway no. R880). The site is nearby the widely used Londa Kheya Ghat at Kalapara Upazila. Transport of heavy equipment can be made by an adjacent river route. The site is approximately 13 km away from the nearest Upazila

STAFF_NOTE: Despite news articles that identify the lending terms for the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project as non-concessional, the grant element is 43.52%, so we code it as a concessional loan. We also code the project as having mixed (development and commercial) intent because the power plant is being partially financed via equity contributions (described in Project ID #56005). Other English names for the Payra Coal-fired Power Plant Project include 'Payra Power Hub' and the alternative spellings of ‚ÄúPyra‚Äù and ‚ÄúPaira‚Äù.  The Chinese name of the project is ""Â∏ï‰∫öÊãâË∂Ö‰∏¥ÁïåÁáÉÁÖ§ÁîµÁ´ô"" This project should not be confused with any of the joint-development agreements for the Payra 3600 MW LNG-to-Power Project signed by NWPGCL and Siemens (Germany). 

Also, note that there are three different power plants being constructed in the Patuakhali region of Bangladesh. Each one of these projects is funded partially via joint ventures between Chinese and Bangladeshi state-owned enterprises and partially via China Eximbank loans. Two of the coal-fired plants will contain two 660MW generators, with the third project involves two phases, both of which have two 660MW generators. The joint venture partners have clarified that these plants are near each other, but they are distinct plants supporting a region-wide electrification campaign. 

These projects include: (1) Bangladesh‚Äôs Northwest Power Generation Company Ltd. and China National Machinery Import & Export Corporation, which established the Bangladesh-China Power Company Ltd. (BCPCL) joint venture in October 2014 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Ultra Supercritical Coal Based Thermal Power Plant Project (Phase 2). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56005. China Eximbank is funding phase one (units 1 and 2) of this project (see Project ID #52748). China Eximbank financing for phase two (units 3 and 4) is currently unspecified, with the most recent details record in Project ID #38245. 

(2) Bangladesh‚Äôs Ashuganj Power Station Company Ltd. (APSCL) and China‚Äôs China Energy Engineering Corporation Ltd. (CEEC) established a joint venture in July 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of  Patuakhali 1320MW (2 x 660MW) Coal-Fired Power Plant (Ashuganj/ APSCL). The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56547. CEEC will solicit a loan from the China Eximbank for the debt portion of the project. China Eximbank financing for this project is currently not captured in a stand-alone Project ID#. 

(3) Bangladesh‚Äôs Rural Power Company Ltd. (RPCL) and China‚Äôs NORINCO, which established a joint venture in November 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of 1320MW (2 x 660MW) MW Patuakhali Coal Fired Thermal Power Plant. The joint venture is captured in Project ID #56357.

53584,China Eximbank provides a $467.8 million preferential buyer's credit for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project ID#38349),"On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh.Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The PBC is captured here, in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured in Project ID#38349. The China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‚Äúeffective‚Äù until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong.  In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy, and mineral resources (MPEMR). The Chinese firm was then expected to submit a financial offer on completion of the review. The project was expected to take 36 months, but 19 months into the project (October 2018), the China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau had only completed initial surveying and some design work. Construction began on or around February 20, 2019. Drilling began on March 15, 2019. STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for the China Eximbank PBC is L1120171103A.","Industry, Mining, Construction","http://www.bu.edu/cgef/#/2017/Country/Malaysia, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://newsbase.com/topstories/cpp-wins-bangladesh-pipeline-contract, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwto3uv514o4hpr/IJGlobal%20-%20Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Pipeline%20%28220KM%29%20%26%20Single%20Point%20Mooring%20%28SPM%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qqsuu3xdaor87q/Double%20Pipeline%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.thefinancetoday.net/article/economy/3113/China-funded-projects-in-slow-lane-on-land-acquisition-delays , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/qwo1ntsvrck5dsr/Double%20Pipeline%20China%20Eximbank.pdf?dl=0 , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/1qqsuu3xdaor87q/Double%20Pipeline%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/nr2016/201610/fe65114aadcc4c0ea82f4265e37c2f5a.shtml , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://cpp.cnpc.com.cn/gdjen/newscenter/201903/d3617ec20a2b4f0b879baaea86cbebe7.shtml , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://tbsnews.net/bangladesh/infrastructure/sluggish-single-point-mooring-construction-eat-more-funds-and-time-39705, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/3a5d097c_651e_4f02_aea7_b94d1f75353a/Press%20Release_English.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/page/b09c0301_8d15_49e1_8af9_3231f08b8ad8/Tbl-7.3%20%281%29.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://english.scio.gov.cn/2017-10/30/content_41813152.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://today.thefinancialexpress.com.bd/print/chinese-firm-building-single-mooring-at-bay-1563730380 , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/lwto3uv514o4hpr/IJGlobal%20-%20Bay%20of%20Bengal%20Pipeline%20%28220KM%29%20%26%20Single%20Point%20Mooring%20%28SPM%29%20-%20Bangladesh.pdf?dl=0 , Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://erd.portal.gov.bd/sites/default/files/files/erd.portal.gov.bd/press_release/b2caf26b_7f39_44e8_9a88_3c0e1eacef6b/PR_English_ASIA.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://ep-bd.com/view/details/article/MzE2NA%3D%3D/title?q=Construction+Work+of+Single-Point+Mooring+at+Moheshkhali+Begins , Other; https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/business/2017-10/30/content_33886133.htm , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/business/2016-12/08/content_39878937.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.china-embassy.org/chn/dshd/t1506411.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://energybangla.com/550-4m-single-point-mooring-project-hits-snag/, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,"Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district",,,,Location in location_details,good,https://gist.github.com/cbaehr/d59d0a69efd50ab0870969c5880473d1,district
39369,Chinese Government provides RMB 200 million interest-free loan for Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #33929 and #38969),"In 2000, the Chinese Government offered $53.29 million of debt financing to the Government of Bangladesh to build an 800 ton-per-day di-ammonia phosphate fertilizer plant in Chittagong. The total cost of the project was $59.21 million, and the Government of Bangladesh agreed to supply the remaining $6 million. Under a contract signed between China National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation Limited (COMPLANT) and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Chinese Government agreed to provide an RMB 200 million loan for the project. The loan agreement was finalized on September 13, 2000, and it carried the following terms: 20-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 0% interest rate. COMPLANT agreed to provide an additional $29.11 million from a supplier‚Äôs credit, which in turn funded with the proceeds from an export seller‚Äôs credit that it received (see Project ID#38969). Construction of the di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer plant ‚Äî known as Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) ‚Äî was expected to begin at the end of 2000 and projected to commence operations within 30 months. However, the project did not commence until April 2004 and it was not completed until June 2006. In August 2016, an ammonia tank at the plant exploded, causing at least 50 people to fall sick from inhaling toxic gas. The emission of toxic ammonia at the fertilizer factory was brought under control on August 23, 2016, some 11 hours after one of two smaller 500-tonne capacity ammonia storage tanks exploded. Fifty people were admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH). BCIC, which now runs the factory, formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident. Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) is located within the Anowara Upazilla (SubDistrict) of Chittagong Division.

34217,Chinese Government provides 2 billion taka grant for 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project over the Arial Khan River,"‚ÄúOn July 28, 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh signed an agreement at the Joint Economic Commission to build the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge. Then, the two governments signed an exchange of letters for the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge Construction Project on May 14, 2010. The 700 meters long and 13-meter wide bridge runs over the Arial Khan (Arialkha) river along the Dhaka-Barisal highway. It is located in Kazirtek (Kazirtack) within Madaripur District and about 115km far away from the capital Dhaka.  

The purpose of constructing the bridge, which is also known locally as Kazirtack Bridge (Bangla translation: ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ú‡¶ø‡¶∞‡¶ü‡ßá‡¶ï ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶ú), was to ease travel between Dhaka and Barisal. Of the entire bridge construction cost (2,943,014,000 taka), approximately 2,001,183,600 taka was granted by the Chinese Government. Anhui Construction Engineering Group (ACEG) was responsible for project implementation. Construction began on May 1, 2012. Project completion was originally expected on June 30, 2016. However, the project was finished ahead of schedule, and the project handover ceremony was held on August 26, 2015.  

Its exact locational coordinates are available at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Asmot+Ali+Khan+Bridge/@23.1697927,90.2329958,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x37556de94d5e9c5f:0xefd0a5ccbaaeeb9d!8m2!3d23.1697878!4d90.2351845

STAFF_NOTE: The grant funding for this project is assumed to be separate from the RMB 100 million grant from the Chinese Government‚Äî through an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) signed in 2009‚Äî that is described in Project ID #53972. The ECTA was signed in December 2009 and Bangladesh's Economic Relations Division indicates that no funding had been disbursed as of 2017, while the Chinese government committed to funding the 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge in July 2009 and fully disbursed the funding. Note that the Government of Bangladesh also uses the following titles to describe this project: Asmot Ali Khan Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge over Arial Khan River of Madaripur (Mostafapur)-Shariatpur-Chandpur Road and 7th Bangladesh-China Friendship Bridge (Kazirtack Bridge)-Over Arial Khan River with other Three Bridge at Madaripur(Mostafapur)-Shariatpur-Chandpur Road (Madaripur Part).",Transport and Storage,"https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020090729e57s0001e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020090804e58400008&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.rthd.gov.bd/admin/profiles/donation/rthd_10.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.plancomm.gov.bd/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/SFYP_Part-2.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=99129, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://china.org.cn/world/2012-01/04/content_24321132.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thefinancialexpress-bd.com/old/2009/07/29/74687.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.chineseembassy.org/chn/xwdt/t894751.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.icsin.org/uploads/2015/04/07/3a1f826bfc9c06bd80ae0d2d7372e535.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://www.iosrjournals.org/iosr-jef/papers/vol3-issue1/Version-1/B03110919.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://www.bashundharagroup.com/anhui-construction-praises-quality-of-king-brand-cement, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://hkgzaixian.com/enterprise/show/2017-04-24/541.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://yws.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zt_obor/subjecte/201508/20150801089741.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://world.people.com.cn/n1/2017/0509/c1002-29264161.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://bd.china-embassy.org/chn/xwdt/t894751.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://img.imsilkroad.com/a/10001/201805/1526867078710.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://jjhzj.mofcom.gov.cn/article/y/201508/20150801095703.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://bd2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralcooperation/bilateralagreement/201005/20100506913230.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://cptu.gov.bd/advertisement-goods/details-57707.html , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kazirtack+Bridge+(%E0%A6%95%E0%A6%BE%E0%A6%9C%E0%A6%BF%E0%A6%B0%E0%A6%9F%E0%A7%87%E0%A6%95+%E0%A6%AC%E0%A7%8D%E0%A6%B0%E0%A7%80%E0%A6%9C),+Madaripur+-+Dhaka+Hwy,+Bangladesh/@23.1836089,90.2387166,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x37556df3082c62b5:0xe7afea44a6976f68!8m2!3d23.183604!4d90.2409053 , Other; http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Project%20Monitoring/SingleProjectDetails.asp?SelectedProjectID=3839 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.rhd.gov.bd/Project%20Monitoring/SingleProjectDetails.asp?SelectedProjectID=3845 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://web.archive.org/web/20130318014315/http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/ND24Df03.html , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.aceg.com.cn/main/model/newinfo/newinfo.do?infoId=21248, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui_Construction_Engineering_Group, Other; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anhui_Construction_Engineering_Group, Other; http://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2017-05/11/c_136274644.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.people.cn/90883/7695209.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=UNIBAG0020090729e57s0001e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/aa/?ref=FNEXBD0020090804e58400008&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","23¬∞10'11.3""N 90¬∞14'06.6""E",,,http://en.people.cn/90883/7695209.html,Locations of all three districts are in the source,good,https://gist.github.com/cbaehr/74ef304d037f0f7f0c4c43f14312b364,district

33929,"Chinese Government provides RMB 239.6 million loan for Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertilizer Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID #39369, #38969)","In 2000, the Chinese Government offered $53.29 million of debt financing to the Government of Bangladesh to build an 800 ton-per-day di-ammonia phosphate fertilizer plant in Chittagong. The total cost of the project was $59.21 million, and the Government of Bangladesh agreed to supply the remaining $6 million. Under a contract signed between China National Complete Plant Import and Export Corporation Limited (COMPLANT) and Bangladesh Chemical Industries Corporation (BCIC), the Chinese Government agreed to provide an RMB 200 million loan for the project. The loan agreement was finalized on September 13, 2000, and it carried the following terms: 20-year maturity, 10 year grace period, 0% interest rate. COMPLANT agreed to provide an additional $29.11 million from a supplier‚Äôs credit, which in turn funded with the proceeds from an export seller‚Äôs credit that it received (see Project ID#38969). A follow-on loan agreement with the Chinese Government for an ‚Äú800 Metric Tons of 800 MT DI-AMMONIUM PHOSPHATE (DAP) Project‚Äù was signed on September 7, 2005 (see Government of Bangladesh loan ID# L1120050907a).

Construction of the di-ammonium phosphate fertilizer plant ‚Äî known as Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) ‚Äî was expected to begin at the end of 2000 and projected to commence operations within 30 months. However, the project did not commence until April 2004 and it was not completed until June 2006. In August 2016, an ammonia tank at the plant exploded, causing at least 50 people to fall sick from inhaling toxic gas. The emission of toxic ammonia at the fertilizer factory was brought under control on August 23, 2016, some 11 hours after one of two smaller 500-tonne capacity ammonia storage tanks exploded. Fifty people, including women, were admitted to the Chittagong Medical College Hospital (CMCH). BCIC, which now runs the factory, formed a 10-member committee to investigate the incident. Di-Ammonium Phosphate Fertiliser Company Ltd (DAPFCL) is located within the Anowara Upazilla (SubDistrict) of Chittagong Division.

33946,CMC provides $71 million supplier‚Äôs credit for Karnaphuli Paper Mills Modernization Project,"On May 7, 2001, China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation (CMC) signed supplier's credit agreement with the Government of Bangladesh for the Balancing, Modernisation, Rehabilitation and Expansion (BMRE) of the Karnaphuli Paper Mills in Chittagong. CMC, in turn, secured the funds for the supplier‚Äôs credit from an export seller‚Äôs credit from China Eximbank.  The total contract value was $84 million, and China Eximbank agreed to cover approximately 85% of the contract value, or $70.965 million. The supplier‚Äôs credit carried the following terms: 16-year maturity, 3 year grace period, and a 3.5% interest rate. The Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs loan identification number for this supplier‚Äôs credit is S1120010507a. The Karnaphuli Paper Mills BMRE Project was intended to expand the production capacity of Karnaphuli Paper Mills from 37500 metric tonnes to 85500 metric tonnes per year, as well as improve the output paper quality of the mill. In 2005, China reportedly agreed to convert the supplier's credit into a concessional loan. However, after the BNP-Jamaat alliance government assumed office, they ‚Äúshelved‚Äù the project without explanation. The idea of the project resumed again in 2014, the loan was reportedly converted into a zero-interest loan worth $87 million. According to the Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs Economic Relations Division (ERD), none of the committed funding had been disbursed as of June 30, 2018, so we assume that this project never reached the implementation stage. The Karnaphuli Paper Mills is located in Chandraghona in Chittagong Division.

34161,Chinese Government provides RMB 9.35 million grant for construction of Chittagong Primary School and Rangpur Primary School,"In 2009, the Chinese Government and the Government of Bangladesh met at the 12th session of the Joint Commission (JC) and discussed the possibility of China providing assistance for building two primary schools. Bangladesh had initially sought assistance to build 5 schools. In September 2011, China Heilongjiang International Economic and Technical Cooperation Corporation and the Ministry of Primary and Mass Education of Bangladesh represented their respective governments and signed a contract to construct two rural primary schools with grant funding from the Chinese Government. Construction of the schools was expected to begin in November 2011 and to be completed within 15 months. The total contract amount was 9.35 million yuan. Chongqing Meilian International Warehouse and Transport Group Co Ltd were responsible for delivering essential construction items from China to Bangladesh for the construction of the schools.

69292,Bank of Communications lends 50 Million USD as part of a syndicated loan for the Chapainawabganj 100MW Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) Power Project,"On May 25, 2015, a $112 million loan agreement between the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB), HSBC, and Bank of Communications was signed. Bank of Communications reportedly contributed a $50 million export buyer's credit to this loan syndicate. The loan reportedly has a 12-year maturity, a two-year grace period, and a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Bangladesh. The loan covers 100% of the EPC costs and comes with full ECA cover from Finnvera and Sinosure. Associated costs and expenses have been financed under an uncovered facility. Finnvera is covering a total of $46.9 million with Sinosure guaranteeing the remainder. Both guarantees effectively reinsure a 100% sovereign guarantee from the Bangladeshi government, which owns BPDB. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation was the accountable party of the credit agreement. The proceeds of the loan are being used to finance the EPC contract and turbine procurement from Hubei Electric Power Survey and Design Institute and Wartsila Finland. The $131 million project is sponsored by Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and it involves around $47 million for 12 Wartsila 20V32 heavy fuel oil engines, with the remainder covering EPC costs generated by Hubei Electric Power Survey and Design Institute, which is building the plant under a 450-day turnkey EPC contract and is providing a two-year warranty and a four-year service and maintenance contract. Although the plant came with a relatively high generation cost (Tk21.70 per kilowatt-hour [kWh] as compared with between Tk6.0 and Tk18 per kWh for other Bangladeshi HFO plants), the project has significant political backing as it is part of Bangladesh‚Äôs Power System Master Plan 2010 and will help improve the overall electricity supply to export processing zones that have been established in the north-west of the country.

The Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs loan identification number for the GCL is L1120161014B.  The Dasherkandi Sewage Treatment Plant is located in Dasherkandi, Dhaka (the capital of Bangladesh), on the eastern side of the Gojaria River. Designed with a daily sewage treatment capacity of 500,000 cubic meters, the plant mainly deals with wastewater in Desherkandi, Hatirjheel, Gulshan, Banani, and Badda in order to eliminate the pollution of the Balu River. The plant includes sewage pumping stations, a 4.8-km-long sewage transport pipe, sewage treatment plants, and a sludge incineration system, which is the largest of its kind in South Asia. The project officially started on August 19, 2018.  The planned completion of the project is in 2021. Upon completion, this project will reportedly provide modern sewerage service to about 5 million people of Gulshan, Banani, Baridhara, Bashundhara, parliament, and adjoining areas including Hatirjheel of the city.

34237,ICBC provides $224 million buyer‚Äôs credit loan for 3rd Phase of Barapukuria Power Station Project (Linked to Project ID#52735 and ID#33957),"In January 2014, ICBC provided $224 million buyer‚Äôs credit to a joint venture of Harbin Electic International Co., Ltd. and CCC Engineering Ltd to increase the capacity of the 250MW Barapukuria coal-fired thermal power station by 275 MW, the third phase of the expansion project. The remainder of the estimated cost of the $330.52 million project was to be funded by the Government of Bangladesh. The buyer‚Äôs credit reportedly carried an interest rate of 3.99% a maturity of 13 years, a management fee of 1.5%, an insurance premium of 6.62%, and a commitment fee of 1%. The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for this buyer's credit on February 16, 2015.  Harbin Electric International and CCC Engineering China were the contractors responsible for project implementation. The exact locational coordinates of the power plant are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/40466.

As of August 2, 2016, 40 percent of the power plant project was complete. The power plant was connected to the power grid on November 10, 2017,  Harbin Electric International and CCC Engineering China originally expected to complete the project in June 2018. However, the project was finished ahead of schedule on May 27, 2018.

On July 22, 2018, the Barapukuria coal-fired power plant was shut down after the discovery of the ‚ÄúBarapukuria coal scam‚Äù, which was a corruption scandal concerning the misappropriation of around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion by officials of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) from the coal mine of Barapukuria, Dinajpur District, in northern Bangladesh. The scandal was revealed in July 2018 when a board member of the Bangladesh Power Development Board went to visit the coal mine and found no fresh coal whereas according to the document there should have been around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal reserved. The matter came to light when a Bangladeshi English-language daily reported the incident. 

Petrobangla, the parent organization of the BCMCL, promptly suspended a few officials in this connection while the Anti-Corruption Commission started an inquiry to trace the corruption. Barapukuria's coal-fired power plant suspended its operations due to the shortage of coal as an immediate effect of the corruption scandal. Before the shutdown of the plant, it had been supplying around 380MW power to the national grid on an average. When the power plant shut down the first time, the people of eight northern districts of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions suffered from a lack of electricity.  BPDB then decided to restart one of its units for five days on August 20, 2018. On August 28, 2018, the plant shut down again.

34340,China Eximbank provides RMB 860 million government concessional loan for Phase II of Info-Sarker Project (Linked to Project ID #38335),"On May 31, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed an RMB 860 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Phase II of the Info-Sarker Project. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. According to a 2016 ODA report from the Economic Relations Division (ERD) of the Government of Bangladesh, RMB 767.325 million had been disbursed through the China Eximbank GCL by 2017.  Phase II of the Info-Sarker Project, which is also known as the Development of National ICT Infra-Network for Bangladesh Government Phase II Project, sought to consolidate and link all Bangladeshi government offices ‚Äî at both district and sub-district levels ‚Äî under a single network. It was an extension of the BanglaGovNet project implemented by the Bangladesh Computer Council whereby all ministries/divisions, major departments, deputy commissioner‚Äôs offices, and upazillas were to be connected under an ICT Backbone Network. Phase II of the project involved significant improvements in the Bangladesh Government‚Äôs efficiency, transparency, effectiveness, and quality of services through the expansion of the network and other facilities established in Phase I of the BanglaGovNet project. China Machinery and Equipment Engineering Co., Ltd. and Huawei serve as the general contractor and major subcontractor for this project, respectively. This project, which was completed on or around March 4, 2016, ultimately brought 18,130 government offices at the district and sub-district levels under an ICT network, paving the way for the prime minister's office and other ministries and departments in Dhaka to establish direct communications around the country. 800 video conferencing systems were also installed at different offices, including the ministries, government departments, and training centers. Additionally, a disaster recovery center was established and a training center for developing ICT capabilities was established at the Bangladesh Computer Council (BCC). STAFF_NOTE: The Government of Bangladesh loan identification number for this China Eximbank GCL is L1120130531a. The project is sometimes also referred to as Phase II Project of Bangladesh National Infrastructure Network.
