This summit was held in 2011, so that year has been coded as the commitment year. No other available Budget in Statistics documents include information on the 17th SAARC Summit, and there are no Budget in Statistics documents available for 2010-2012. It is unclear what specific kind of aid China provided. According to a 2011 Reuters article, the post-summit giveaway bag included porcelain pens and diaries from the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry detailing “Five Years of China-SAARC Cooperation.” Additionally, a box for a new 40-inch TV in the media center was labeled ""China Aid"". According to a 2015 Nepal Republic Media article, China distributed bags with the slogan ""China-SAARC friendship"" at the 2011 SAARC Summit in the Maldives. The intent has been coded as Mixed, because based on media sources it appears the aid likely had at least some representational intent.","Support to Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Government Organizations","https://www.reuters.com/article/us-maldives-china-india-idUSTRE7AF0DT20111116, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.finance.gov.mv/public/attachments/BFdQChbFNpNL5dXAsb67yjlwEPD6FhJqwTcdtVdv.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.mv/public/attachments/BFdQChbFNpNL5dXAsb67yjlwEPD6FhJqwTcdtVdv.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=HTREPB0020150202eb1v000dy&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=HTREPB0020150202eb1v000dy&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,"","","",""
