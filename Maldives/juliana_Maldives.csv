38083,"China Eximbank provides 373.8 million USD loan for Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#53268)","On September 16, 2014, during Xi Jinping's state visit to the Maldives, the Chinese Government and the Government of Maldives signed the ""Preliminary Contract Agreement on the Expansion and Upgrading of Ibrahim Nasir International Airport"" that China would participate in the construction of an additional runway and bridge leading to the Velana International Airport (previously known as Ibrahim Nasir International airport) in Malé, Maldives.On December 28, 2015, the Maldives secured a preferential buyer's credit loan agreement worth $373,838,500 USD (see Feb. 2019 ""ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS"") from the Export-Import Bank of China. According to the Maldives Independent, the loan had a maturity period of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. According to Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL)'s Financial Year 2018 report, the interest rate was 3%. The principal was to be paid in thirty equal semiannual installments on January 21 and July 21 each year and the first repayment was to commence on the first available payment date falling five years after date of withdrawal - November 2, 2016. The Government of Maldives provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury then used proceeds from the Eximbank loan to on-lend to the MACL in the Maldivian Rufiyaa currency. As of December 31, 2018, $211,137,789 had been disbursed.According to IJGlobal, in August 2016 total investment in the expansion of the airport is was $800 million USD. Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) was given the contract to expand the airport after a $511 million deal with India’s GMR Infrastructure was cancelled by the Maldivian government, according to Reuters and the BRICS Post.The project involved the construction of a new 3,400 meters long and 65 meters wide runway, reclaim land, and develop a 45 million liter capacity fuel farm and an 80,000 ton cargo complex, according to the Maldives Independent in 2017. The project's groundbreaking ceremony was on February 27, 2017, according to the Chinese Embassy to the Maldives. Xinhua Silk Road Information Service reported that the paving construction of the new runway was completed on August 24, 2018. Then, according to Raajje, an A380 airplane landed on the newly constructed runway on September 18, 2018. The Global Times declared this moment as the completion of the Belt and Road initiative project.This project is separate from, though related to, the Seaplane Facilities of the Velana International Airport Project, which is funded by CDB and captured in project ID #54268.Velana International Airport (VIA) (IATA: MLE, ICAO: VRMM) is the main international airport in the Maldives. It is located on Hulhulé Island in the North Malé Atoll, nearby the capital island Malé.

According to Chinese Embassy to Sri Lanka, Shandong Expressway Qilu Construction Group Co., Ltd. constructed the project.　The ground-breaking ceremony was held on November 12, 2007. The museum was handed over to the Maldives on July 10, 2010, and opened on Independence Day, July 26, 2010. It consisted of two large buildings in the old palace grounds.

Since at least March 2016, the Maldivian government, with Jiangsu Fenghai New Energy Seawater Desalination Development Co., Ltd., had been discussing this project. In 2017, Fenghai New Energy Seawater Desalination Equipment is a self-developed containerized smart micro-grid desalination system independently developed by China that does not rely on the power grid, instead using wind, solar and other clean energy to generate drinkable water. In 2018, the complete seawater desalination equipment saves and recycles energy, greatly reducing the cost of seawater desalination. Five sets of plants were to be sold to the Maldives. Each 48.441 kW plant was to be located on a different island. The five islands were K. Kaashidhoo, Lh.Kurendhoo, R.Alifushi, Ha.Kelaa, and Ga.Dhaandhoom. The plants will benefit more than 8,000 residents of related islands.
