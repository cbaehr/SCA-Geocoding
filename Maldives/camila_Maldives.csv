69440,"Chinese Government funds free cataract operations from Bright Journey Eye Cap and donates equipment worth MVR 3.5 million (Linked to Project ID#52444, #69381, #53776)","According to the Chinese Embassy to the Maldives, from September 6 to September 16, 2017, a Chinese medical team of 13 experts performed nearly 100 free cataract surgeries at Hulhumalé Hospital and Gan Regional Hospital in Laamu Atol as part of the Chinese-government backed Bright Journey Eye Camp. On September 11, the Chinese donated the eye camp's medical facilities to the Maldives. Many patients had been blind due to inaccessibility to medical treatment for various reasons, and because of the Chinese doctors, were able to recover their vision after treatment, according to the Embassy. According to Life of Guangzhou, the Chinese doctors also taught the local doctors how to perform the operations.According to Sun Online, the eye camp was organized by the Maldivian Health Ministry and the Chinese National Health and Family Planning Commission. The Chinese ophthalmologists were to arrive on July 31, 2017 to prepare for the camp. The doctors were to begin consulting at Hulhumalé Hospital on August 1 and at Laamu Gan Regional Hospital on August 2 and 3.For the Bright Journey eye camp in 2016, see project ID #52444. For the eye camp performed by doctors from Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center in 2020, see project ID#69381. For the China-Maldives Ophthalmology Centre, see project ID #53776. STAFF_NOTE: The actual arrival date of the medical team could not be confirmed; The exact transaction amount is not provided, but Maldives Ministry of Health reported the combined the accumulated values of the medical equipment donated by the 2015 camp (captured in project ID#52444) and the 2017 camp (captured in project ID#69440) as ""More than MVR 9.2 million.""
