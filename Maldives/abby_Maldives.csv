Local media reported that the Housing Ministry had used ceramic tiles instead of marble. Housing Minister Dr. Mohamed Muizzu blamed the contractors for using low-quality materials and not living up to the ministry's standards, and said that the contractor would redo the project free of charge. The courtyard was walled off in December 2016 for the redo, the cracked tiles were replaced in March 2017, and the courtyard was opened back up immediately.STAFF_NOTE: The Maldives Government Budget in Statistics 2018 document reports as the actual 2016 grant disbursement for 2016 as 17,468,083 MVR was taken for this project.

According to Dongfang Electric's website, this project involved the construction of a diesel engine power plant with installed capacity of 50MW and two sets of seawater desalination systems each with capacity of 960 tons per day (by utilizing flue gas from the power plant). Once operation, the power plant was to provide sufficient electricity to satisfy the demand of consumption for economic and social development in the greater Malé region, and as well as guarantee a supply of power transmission in the area. The plant was also to become a supply of fresh water for residents, tourists and industry. The Maldivian reported that the plant will guarantee electricity coverage for the next 10 to 20 years for Malé and Hulhumalé.

35020,China Eximbank provides RMB 982.5 million loan for Phase 2 of Development of 1500 Housing Units Project,"On September 2, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Maldives signed an RMB 982,500,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of Development of 1,500 Housing Units Project. The loan was export buyer's credit (see ""ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS""). The loan has a 20 year maturity, according an archived Sun Online article. After the loan is fully disbursed, the Government of Maldives was to pay RMB 17.74 million ($2.3 million USD or MVR35.5 million) yearly as interest during the grace period. By the end of the loan period in 2033, the government was to have paid $183.14 million USD (MVR2.8 billion).The loan originally dates back to 2011, when the taking of the loan was submitted to the Maldivian parliament by then-President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed for the construction of 1,500 housing units in four southern atolls, according to Sun Online. However, to the lack of loan details, the Parliament Public Accounts Committee investigated it, and discovered that some details had changed, requiring furthering probing. The details of the loan was approved on December 29, 2011, but then the government requested changes to the loan, in order to finance the construction of 704 housing units in Hulhumalé. In July 2014, the Public Accounts Committee voted to approve the changes to the loan.The project broke ground on December 9, 2014, when the President of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom laid the ‎foundation stone of the 704 housing units to be constructed in Hulhumalé., as reported by the President's Office. The 1,500 housing units, which were built by contractor China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and dispersed across eight different islands across the Maldives, were officially completed and handed over on December 4, 2017. Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure of Maldives was also involved in the project. The project was intended to deal with housing shortages faced by young Maldivians. A breakdown of the 1500 housing unit locations by island, taken from Avas, is as follows:- Hulhumalé, Kaafu atoll – 704 housing units- Hithadhoo, Addu atoll – 264 housing units- Hulhumeedhoo, Addu atoll – 48 housing units- Fuvahmulah, Gnaviyani atoll – 200 housing units- Villingili, Gaafu Alif atoll – 52 housing units- Gahdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 50 housing units- Thinadhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 120 housing units- Madaveli, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 22 housing units- Hoadehdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 40 housing unitsFor the Thinadhoo Island project listed above, the inauguration ceremony occurred in 2015. 80 of the 120 housing units were designated for Thinadhoo residents, 25 of the 120 housing units were allotted for people who migrated to the island, and the rest were to be sold through open bidding.Disbursements per year of the China Eximbank loan proceeds were as follows, according to Maldives government sources (and denominated in local currency MVR): - 2013: 722,137,500 MVR (according to Budget in Statistics 2015)- 2015: 408,181,393 MVR [actual] (according to Budget in Statistics 2017)- 2016: 727,400,058 MVR [actual] (according to Budget in Statistics 2018)- 2017: 269,306,723 MVR [actual] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)- 2018: 63,239,487 MVR [revised] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)- 2019: 72,174,857 MVR [budgeted] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)",Other Social infrastructure and services,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BBCSAP0020120904e894002e5&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks;
