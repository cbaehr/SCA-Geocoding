According to its 2016 Annual Report, Maldives Transport and Contracting Company PLC did the flooring, marbling and landscaping of the project.The project was completed in June 2016. In July 2016, cracks began to appear in the marble flooring. The Housing Ministry, which received the check and made the arrangements with the contractor, was accused of corruption and criticized. Local media reported that the Housing Ministry had used ceramic tiles instead of marble. Housing Minister Dr. Mohamed Muizzu blamed the contractors for using low-quality materials and not living up to the ministry's standards, and said that the contractor would redo the project free of charge. The courtyard was walled off in December 2016 for the redo, the cracked tiles were replaced in March 2017, and the courtyard was opened back up immediately.STAFF_NOTE: The Maldives Government Budget in Statistics 2018 document reports as the actual 2016 grant disbursement for 2016 as 17,468,083 MVR was taken for this project.

The Government of Maldives provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan. As of late September 2018, the disbursed outstanding debt through the ICBC loan was 209,076,877 USD. The loan was largest one ever taken by the Maldivian government to fund a housing project.

35020,China Eximbank provides RMB 982.5 million loan for Phase 2 of Development of 1500 Housing Units Project,"On September 2, 2012, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Government of Maldives signed an RMB 982,500,000 loan agreement for Phase 2 of Development of 1,500 Housing Units Project. The loan was export buyer's credit (see ""ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS""). The loan has a 20 year maturity, according an archived Sun Online article. After the loan is fully disbursed, the Government of Maldives was to pay RMB 17.74 million ($2.3 million USD or MVR35.5 million) yearly as interest during the grace period. By the end of the loan period in 2033, the government was to have paid $183.14 million USD (MVR2.8 billion).The loan originally dates back to 2011, when the taking of the loan was submitted to the Maldivian parliament by then-President of the Maldives Mohamed Nasheed for the construction of 1,500 housing units in four southern atolls, according to Sun Online. However, to the lack of loan details, the Parliament Public Accounts Committee investigated it, and discovered that some details had changed, requiring furthering probing. The details of the loan was approved on December 29, 2011, but then the government requested changes to the loan, in order to finance the construction of 704 housing units in Hulhumalé. In July 2014, the Public Accounts Committee voted to approve the changes to the loan.The project broke ground on December 9, 2014, when the President of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom laid the ‎foundation stone of the 704 housing units to be constructed in Hulhumalé., as reported by the President's Office. The 1,500 housing units, which were built by contractor China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) and dispersed across eight different islands across the Maldives, were officially completed and handed over on December 4, 2017. Ministry of Housing and Infrastructure of Maldives was also involved in the project. The project was intended to deal with housing shortages faced by young Maldivians. A breakdown of the 1500 housing unit locations by island, taken from Avas, is as follows:- Hulhumalé, Kaafu atoll – 704 housing units- Hithadhoo, Addu atoll – 264 housing units- Hulhumeedhoo, Addu atoll – 48 housing units- Fuvahmulah, Gnaviyani atoll – 200 housing units- Villingili, Gaafu Alif atoll – 52 housing units- Gahdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 50 housing units- Thinadhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 120 housing units- Madaveli, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 22 housing units- Hoadehdhoo, Gaafu Dhaal atoll – 40 housing unitsFor the Thinadhoo Island project listed above, the inauguration ceremony occurred in 2015. 80 of the 120 housing units were designated for Thinadhoo residents, 25 of the 120 housing units were allotted for people who migrated to the island, and the rest were to be sold through open bidding.Disbursements per year of the China Eximbank loan proceeds were as follows, according to Maldives government sources (and denominated in local currency MVR): - 2013: 722,137,500 MVR (according to Budget in Statistics 2015)- 2015: 408,181,393 MVR [actual] (according to Budget in Statistics 2017)- 2016: 727,400,058 MVR [actual] (according to Budget in Statistics 2018)- 2017: 269,306,723 MVR [actual] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)- 2018: 63,239,487 MVR [revised] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)- 2019: 72,174,857 MVR [budgeted] (according to Loans - Budget 2019)",Other Social infrastructure and services,"https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BBCSAP0020120904e894002e5&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

38083,China Eximbank provides 373.8 million USD loan for Velana International Airport Upgrade and Expansion Upgrade and Expansion Project (Linked to Project ID#53268),"On September 16, 2014, during Xi Jinping's state visit to the Maldives, the Chinese Government and the Government of Maldives signed the ""Preliminary Contract Agreement on the Expansion and Upgrading of Ibrahim Nasir International Airport"" that China would participate in the construction of an additional runway and bridge leading to the Velana International Airport (previously known as Ibrahim Nasir International airport) in Malé, Maldives.On December 28, 2015, the Maldives secured a preferential buyer's credit loan agreement worth $373,838,500 USD (see Feb. 2019 ""ACTIVE EXTERNAL LOANS"") from the Export-Import Bank of China. According to the Maldives Independent, the loan had a maturity period of 20 years, including a 5-year grace period. According to Maldives Airports Company Limited (MACL)'s Financial Year 2018 report, the interest rate was 3%. The principal was to be paid in thirty equal semiannual installments on January 21 and July 21 each year and the first repayment was to commence on the first available payment date falling five years after date of withdrawal - November 2, 2016. The Government of Maldives provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan. The Maldives Ministry of Finance and Treasury then used proceeds from the Eximbank loan to on-lend to the MACL in the Maldivian Rufiyaa currency. As of December 31, 2018, $211,137,789 had been disbursed.According to IJGlobal, in August 2016 total investment in the expansion of the airport is was $800 million USD. Beijing Urban Construction Group (BUCG) was given the contract to expand the airport after a $511 million deal with India’s GMR Infrastructure was cancelled by the Maldivian government, according to Reuters and the BRICS Post.The project involved the construction of a new 3,400 meters long and 65 meters wide runway, reclaim land, and develop a 45 million liter capacity fuel farm and an 80,000 ton cargo complex, according to the Maldives Independent in 2017. The project's groundbreaking ceremony was on February 27, 2017, according to the Chinese Embassy to the Maldives. Xinhua Silk Road Information Service reported that the paving construction of the new runway was completed on August 24, 2018. Then, according to Raajje, an A380 airplane landed on the newly constructed runway on September 18, 2018. The Global Times declared this moment as the completion of the Belt and Road initiative project.This project is separate from, though related to, the Seaplane Facilities of the Velana International Airport Project, which is funded by CDB and captured in project ID #54268.Velana International Airport (VIA) (IATA: MLE, ICAO: VRMM) is the main international airport in the Maldives. It is located on Hulhulé Island in the North Malé Atoll, nearby the capital island Malé.

In 2018, the complete seawater desalination equipment saves and recycles energy, greatly reducing the cost of seawater desalination. Five sets of plants were to be sold to the Maldives. Each 48.441 kW plant was to be located on a different island. The five islands were K. Kaashidhoo, Lh.Kurendhoo, R.Alifushi, Ha.Kelaa, and Ga.Dhaandhoom.
