34512,China cancels £9.6 millions of Afghanistan’s outstanding debt obligations (Linked to Project ID #34505),"In March 2004, the Chinese Government agreed to cancel 9.6 million British pounds (or approximately $18.8 million) of the Government of Afghanistan's outstanding debt obligations. These debt obligations were originally contracted by the Afghan government in 1965. 

This act of debt forgiveness likely covered the bulk of the Government of Afghanistan’s outstanding debt obligations to China from 2002 to 2010, which were worth $19.5 million. 

STAFF_NOTE: This project may be linked to Project ID#34505, which captures a 2002 commitment by the Chinese Government to write off all of Afghanistan's outstanding debt obligations.

34642,150 million RMB to Afghanistan Ministry of Finance,"On 8 June 2012, at the annual summit of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), China announced its plan to provide 150 million Chinese Yuan in grant to the Afghan Ministry of Finance. Based on an interview with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Yings, this was the second 150 million CNY-grant that was offered by China. The agreement to provide the first 150 million CNY worth of grant was signed on 31 December 2011 (See Project ID#34601). Minister Fu Yings also said that China and Afghanistan would identify projects that could use the grant. A Joint Declaration between The People's Republic of China and The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Establishing Strategic and Cooperative Partnership was then released on June 16 2012 which stated that both sides will 'continually strengthen the pragmatic cooperation in such fields as resources and energy development, infrastructure development, engineering and agriculture'. It was also suggested that the grant will be going to 'peaceful reconstruction process'. STAFF_NOTE: This project was initially coded as being a duplicate of ID #34601, however, according to information published on the website of China's ECCO in Kabul, 150 million CNY assistance packages were pledged consecutively in 2011 and 2012. Furthermore, it was mentioned in the CSIS report that China's grant to Afghanistan from 2002 to 2010 is about US$205.3 million while the report by the 'Diplomat' has mentioned that the total amount of grant from 2002 to 2011 is about US$250 million. The reports show that there is at least 150 million CNY that was provided to Afghanistan in 2011, and the 150 million CNY that was offer in 2012 is referring to a separate pledge made by China. Last, the article by Reuters suggest that China's offer of 150 million CNY was part of the strategic partnership agreement signed in 2012, thus further distinguishing this offer of 150 million CNY in aid in 2012 from the one made in 2011.",Unallocated / Unspecified,"https://global-factiva-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BAKHNA0020120925e89o00002&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://af.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zxhz/201501/20150100879514.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://mfa.gov.af/en/news/10504, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://muse.jhu.edu.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/journals/asia_policy/v017/17.huasheng.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://outlookafghanistan.net/national_detail.php?post_id=4589, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://csis.org/files/publication/120322_Zhao_ChinaAfghan_web.pdf, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/06/08/us-china-afghanistan-idUSBRE85705120120608, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://thediplomat.com/2012/08/why-china-should-do-more-in-afghanistan/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://journals.rienner.com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.5555/0258-9184-38.4.497, Academic Journal Article; http://www.bwchinese.com/article/1029353.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.bbc.com/zhongwen/simp/chinese_news/2012/06/120608_china_aid_afhan.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinanews.com/gn/2012/06-08/3948964.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://article.wn.com/view/WNAT39e8568ded92d553e5b8a7444dd60d74/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://finance.jrj.com.cn/2012/06/08115313410504.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://af.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zxhz/201501/20150100879514.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global-factiva-com.libproxy1.nus.edu.sg/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=BAKHNA0020120925e89o00002&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks",NA,country_level,,,"This project is coded up to country level since according to the project description, the grant is going towards multiple other projects within Afghanistan",good code up,,country

Phase-1 (captured by project ID #34509): On March 3, 2004, at the Chinese Embassy in Kabul, Chinese ambassador to Afghanistan, Sun Yuxi and Afghan Irrigation, Water Resources and Environment Minister Mohammad Yusuf Nooristani signed a grant agreement for Phase I of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project. The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate an irrigation canal in Parwan Province, which is one of the most agriculturally productive areas of Afghanistan. 

Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Co., Ltd. (JWHC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The design of the project was finalized on July 6, 2003. Construction began in March 2004, and the project was completed and transferred to the Afghan authorities in October 2006.

Phase-2 (captured by project ID # 69368): In 2010, the Chinese Government committed grant funding for Phase II of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project. The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate an irrigation canal in Parwan Province, which is one of the most agriculturally productive areas of Afghanistan. It involved enlarging the main canal, constructing additional gutters and retaining walls, and building fences around the Charikar pumping station and the Parwan Authority office. The total reported cost of this project is RMB 23 million.

The main (85.578 km) irrigation canal was originally constructed with a grant from the Chinese Government in the late 1960s and 1970s. Construction was initiated on December 31, 1968 and completed on December 31, 1976. It was designed to irrigate 24,800 hectares (or 372,000 acres) of land. However, due to the effects of war and wear and tear, the irrigation canal fell into a state of disrepair and was unable to supply water in a reliable and effective manner.

However, a year after the inauguration of the hospital, it was still empty due to staff shortages and the fact that the Government of Afghanistan had not allocated any operating funds to it. 

Then, in April 2011, Dr. Soraya Dalil, Afghanistan’s acting public health minister announced that the new building suffered from several problems, including a lack of surgery wards and a proper ventilation system. A second inauguration ceremony for this hospital was held on January 21, 2014. The hospital now provides 24-hour services and treats approximately 1,200 patients each day. Its services include: Cardiothoracic Surgery, Respiratory, Vascular Surgery, Neurology, Nephrology, Neurosurgery, Urology, Endocrinology, Oncology-Chemotherapy, and. Oncology-Radiotherapy. The hospital has two buildings: (1) a main building that has 10 floors with 1,000 rooms (with each floor allocated to a different kind of treatment), and (2) a four-story building that provide services for emergency patients, X-ray services, and administrative offices. The annual cost of operating the hospital is about $2.7 million. 

According to ""Foundation Stone of China-funded Hospital Building Laid in Kabul"", the project is different with project ID# 34502 which happened in 2003. Besides funding the construction of the main building, China will also equip the hospital with some medical furniture and instruments, according to agreements reached by the governments of China and Afghanistan, separately in 2003 and 2005.

STAFF_NOTE: This project is also known as the Jamhoryat Tertiary Hospital Construction Project or the Republic Hospital Construction Project. The Chinese project title is 喀布尔共和国医院 or 喀布尔共和国医院. The Farsi name of the project is شفاخانه جمهوریت.

69368,"Chinese Government provides RMB 23 million grant for Phase II of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project (Linked to Project ID #34509, #34498)","In 2010, the Chinese Government committed grant funding for Phase II of the Parwan Water Conservancy Restoration Project. The purpose of this project was to rehabilitate an irrigation canal in Parwan Province, which is one of the most agriculturally productive areas of Afghanistan. It involved enlarging the main canal, constructing additional gutters and retaining walls, and building fences around the Charikar pumping station and the Parwan Authority office. The total reported cost of this project is RMB 23 million. 

Jiangxi Water and Hydropower Construction Co., Ltd. (JWHC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation began on December 31, 2010. The project was completed on June 15, 2012, and the formal project handover ceremony took place on August 15, 2012. 

The main (85.578 km) irrigation canal was originally constructed with a grant from the Chinese Government in the late 1960s and 1970s. Construction was initiated on December 31, 1968 and completed on December 31, 1976. It was designed to irrigate 24,800 hectares (or 372,000 acres) of land. However, due to the effects of war and wear and tear, the irrigation canal fell into a state of disrepair and was unable to supply water in a reliable and effective manner.

Phase-1 of the Parwan Conservancy project is recorded in #34509. In a news article published by the Chinese Embassy Website, the funding for the project was drawn from the US$150 million that China has pledged in 2002 and is a sub-umbrella project of #34498.

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 阿富汗帕尔旺水利增项工程 or 阿富汗帕尔旺水利工程修复（二期. For the time being, we assume that the full cost of the project (RMB 23 million) was the value of the grant funding provided by the Chinese Government.
