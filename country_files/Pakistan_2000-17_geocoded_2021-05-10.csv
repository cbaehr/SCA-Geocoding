38996,"China Eximbank provides a RMB 503 million government concessional loan for Gwadar Port Project (Linked to #38995, #35124, #72688, and #72689)","During the visit of Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji to Pakistan in May 2001, the Gwadar port was a key item of discussion. Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said China has agreed to help fund the construction of phase one of the $250 million Gwadar Port project. China provided $248 million for the project in various forms of funding. On March 24, 2002, China Eximbank committed an RMB 502,690,200 government concessional loan (GCL), which was captured by project ID#38996. Further funding was provided through a $60 million China Eximbank buyer's credit loan (BCL) captured by project ID#38995, a $31 million Chinese Government grant captured by project ID#35124, an $18 million Chinese Government grant captured by project ID#72689, and an interest-free loan from the Chinese Government worth $31 million captured by project ID#72688. Gwadar, located about 350 kilometers west of Karachi on the Arabian Sea coast, is considered the nearest warm water port for the Central Asian states for their trade with Europe, East Asia, and the Americas. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz inaugurated the deep-sea port on March 20, 2007. The Gwadar Port was taken over by China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited (COPHC) on May 16, 2013, for 40 years. STAFF_NOTE: One source suggests that the face value of the BCL may have been downwardly revised to $22.26 million (at a 3% interest rate) after the initial BCL agreement was signed.

Pakistani Finance Minister Shaukat Aziz said China has agreed to help fund the construction of phase one of the $250 million Gwadar Port project.
 
 On August 10, 2001, the Chinese government signed the financial agreement for development of Phase I of the Gwadar Port Project. Under this agreement, China provided $248 million for the project in various forms of funding:
 an RMB 502,690,200 China Eximbank government concessional loan (GCL), which was captured by project ID#38996

 an $18 million Chinese Government grant captured by project ID#72689
 an interest-free loan from the Chinese Government worth $31 million captured by project ID#72688
 
 The $60 million BCL was downwardly revised to $22.26 million (at a 3% interest rate) after the initial BCL agreement was signed. On March 24, 2006, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan and China signed a $22.26 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) agreement for the Gwadar Port Channel Deepening Project. The PBC agreement was signed by Pakistan’s Ambassador to China, Salman Bashir, and Liang Xiang, Assistant President of China Eximbank.
 
 This project involved the dredging of the Gwadar port to 14.5 metres. The objective of the project was to enable 50000 DWT vessels to use the port. China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd (CHEC) -- a subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Limited -- was the contractor responsible for project implementation.
 
 The project is an extension to Phase I of the Gwadar Port Project, which comprised three multi-purposes berths of 602-metre total length and also accommodated roll-on roll-off vessels, a 100-meter service berth, 4.25-kilometer approach channel dredged to 11.5 meter-12.5 meter and demarcated with buoys and turning lights. The channel was successfully deepened to 14.5 meters in February 2007.
 
 Gwadar, located about 350 kilometers west of Karachi on the Arabian Sea coast, is considered the nearest warm water port for the Central Asian states for their trade with Europe, East Asia, and the Americas. Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz inaugurated the deep-sea port on March 20, 2007. The Gwadar Port was taken over by China Overseas Ports Holding Company Limited (COPHC) on May 16, 2013, for 40 years.

52423,"Chinese bank syndicate provides $1.496 billion loan for 2×660MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal in Balochistan Province","On October 24, 2017, China Power Hub Generation Company (Pvt.) Ltd. (CPHGC) signed a $1,496,000,000 syndicated loan agreement with a consortium of banks — including China Development Bank (lead arranger), the Export-Import Bank of China (co-lead arranger), the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank Corporation, and Bank of Communications Co. Limited — for the construction of 2×660MW coal fired units and a dedicated jetty terminal to import coal at Hub, Mouza Kund, Tehsil Gadani, Lasbella District, and Balochistan Province. Each bank reportedly contributed equal amount to the loan syndicate (~$300 million each). 
 
 The estimated terms of the syndicated loan (based on CPHGC's upfront tariff application to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority) are as follows: 14 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and 4.95% interest rate (the 6-month LIBOR rate of 0.45% plus 450 basis points). The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) is $1.995 billion and it is being financed according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio. CPHGC is a project company and joint venture of China Power International Holding Ltd (CPIH) and the Hub Power Company Limited (HUBCO) that was established to finance, design, and implement this 1320 MW imported coal based power project. CPIH has a 74% ownership stake and HUBCO has a 26% ownership stake in CPHGC. CPHGC was granted a generation license by Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) on September 8, 2016. 
 
 The term of the license is 30 years from the date of the commencement of commercial operations. CPHGC also submitted an application for an upfront tariff determination with NEPRA, which was approved on February 12, 2016. Then, on January 25, 2017, the Implementation Agreement (IA) and Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) were signed. Northwest Electric Power Design Institute Co. Ltd. (NWEPDI) and Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited are the EPC contractors for this projectA groundbreaking ceremony took place on March 21, 2017, and on April 10, 2018, CPHGC entered into Operation and Maintenance (O&M) contract with a consortium that consists of CEEC Tianjin (Pakistan) Electric Power Construction (Private) Limited, China Energy Engineering Group, Tianjin Electric Power Construction Company Limited, and China Energy Engineering Group Science and Technology Development Company Limited to provide operation and maintenance service for the coal-fired electric power generation plant. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on August 17, 2019. Its expected commercial operation date was August 31, 2018. It is expected that this power plant will provide 9 billion kWh electricity to Pakistan’s national grid each year, thereby meeting the electricity needs of 4 million Pakistani households. 
 
 Staff Note: CPIH is a wholly-owned subsidiary of State Power Investment Corporation (SPIC), which is one of the top five electricity producers in China. CPIH mainly engages in the development, construction, operation, overseas investment and financing, and capital operation of power generation projects. Hubco is the largest Independent Power Producer (IPP) in Pakistan, with total power generation capacity of over 1600 MW. The company’s assets include a residual fuel oil-fired thermal plant situated at Mouza Kund, Hub, which supplies the national grid.

35306,"CDB provides $54 million loan for Duddar Lead-Zinc Mine Project","On March 22, 2002, China Metallurgical Construction Group Corp (MCC) signed an Memorandum of Understanding with Pakistan Minerals Development Company (PMDC) on the project development. On November 3, 2003, an agreement for the development of the Duddar zinc-lead project was signed, with a total investment worth US$72.64 million. The agreement stipulated that PMDC would be responsible for the construction of external roads leading to the project site. In addition, the Pakistan government would convert the Duddar zinc-lead mine area into an export processing zone (EPZ). 
 
 On March 5, 2004, PMDC transferred its stake in the contract to MCC Resources Development Limited (MRD), which is a wholly owned subsidiary of MCC, authorized to register in Pakistan by the Ministry of Commerce of PRC. In order to manage the project more efficiently, MCC entered into an agreement with several other Chinese companies. With the approval of the Ministry of Commerce of PRC, MCC Duddar Minerals Development Company Pvt. Limited (MDMD), a joint venture of the 3 companies, was registered on November 23, 2004. The consortium was composed of MCC (51%), Hunan Zhuzhou Non-ferrous Metals Smelter Co. Ltd. (34%), and Hunan Huangshaping Lead and Zinc Mine Co. (15%). 
 
 On January 6, 2005, the company signed a financing agreement with China Development Bank. The consortium signed a contract to borrow US$54 million from the China Development Bank to finance the development of the Duddar lead and zinc mine in Pakistan. The loan was expected to fund 80% of the total investment of $72.6 million in the project. The offer has been made by a visiting delegation of China Development Bank, headed by its Provincial Chief, Mei Jia Xiang in a meeting with Managing Director, Pakistan Mineral Development Corporation (PMDC) Brig. Khalid Sajjad Khokhar in Islamabad.
 
 The Duddar project has a designed annual processing capacity of 660,000 tons of ores, including mining and concentration processes. Its final products will be zinc and lead concentrates. The mines have a depth limit of 900 meters underground. The project officially started construction in January 2005 and will continue operations until 2023. Multiple sources refer to the project as being completed.

During January 2017, it was reported that Pakistan's Under Communication Division contributed 310 million Pakistani rupee towards the 110 km section. In December 2017, the funding from China was temporarily paused. After that, no further information can be found about the relaunch of the project. CPEC website confirms the estimated cost of US$80 million. It also suggests that reports on Feasibility and PC-I have been completed and LOI forwarded to Chinese side. According to CPEC website as of Nov 2018, procedural formalities to be completed shortly. The Pakistan Ministry of Finance economic survey for 2018 reports the project is planned to be completed by 2020. A Pakistani government Finance Ministry annual project status report in May from 2017-18 does not specify the total loan commitment, but records that in May from 2017-18 China fulfilled part of the loan at the amount of 11.374 million USD, meaning the project is likely to have started or at least committed.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASPTOD0020161230eccu0002h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dawn.com/news/1374532, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/basima-khuzdar-dual-carriageway/30b047de-8e00-472e-a37d-fe7879e02378/, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/69, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.cpecinfo.com/cpec-news-detail?id=NTEzOA==, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_18/13-Transport_and_Communications.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ead.gov.pk/frmDetails.aspx, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/budget/Estimates_of_Foreign_Assistant_2017_18.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.sjbipp.org/publications/AR/reports/AR-10-17.pdf , Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=NINTPK0020170118ed1i00035&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Qalat_Division, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basima","Qalat Division is coded in this row.

52904,"China Eximbank provide $1.6 billion loan for Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project [CPEC, IPP]","On July 24, 2014, China Eximbank provided a letter of intent to Sinohydro Resources Ltd. to finance the Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project. Then, on October 16, 2015, China Eximbank and Port Qasim Electric Power Company (Pvt.) Limited (PQEPCPL) signed a loan agreement for the Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project. PQEPCPL is a project company (special purpose vehicle) that was established in 2014 for the sole purpose of designing, financing, insuring, building, establishing, owning, operating, maintaining, and managing the Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project. The sponsors and shareholders of PQEPCPL are Sinohydro Resources Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Al-Mirqab Capital (AMC) of Qatar (49% ownership stake). The EPC contractors are Sinohydro Harbour Co., Ltd and CCCC Second Harbor Consultants Co., Ltd. 
 
 The total cost of this project was approximately $2.1 billion and it was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of approximately 75:25. China Eximbank provided a $1,598,380,000 loan for the project, and the remainder was covered via $521 million of equity contributions from Sinohydro Resources Ltd. and AMC. The terms of the loan were as follows: 14 year maturity, 4 year grace rate, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.70% margin. The Government of Pakistan provided a sovereign guarantee for the loan. Sinosure also provided insurance for the loan. These insurance fees amounted to 4% of total debt servicing. As of October 2018, China Eximbank has reportedly had disbursed $975 million through the loan. 
 
 The Port Qasim 2x660 MW Coal-Fired Power Project is located in the Port Qasim Industrial Park (exact locational coordinates: 24.7854°N 67.3695°E), and it consists of two modern supercritical coal-fired units, a self-dedicated coal unloading jetty and a 4 km-length channel dredged and transferred to Port Qasim Authority. The coal will be imported. The project, which is being implemented on build-own-operate (BOO) basis and is one of the largest “Priority Implementation Projects” under China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), has been plagued by controversy. 
 
 Transparency International Pakistan alleged that PQEPCPL and NEPRA colluded to set a tariff for the coal-fired power plant and artificially inflated the cost of the project. A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on April 20, 2015. Construction then began in May 2015. On November 29th, 2017, Yao Jing, the Chinese ambassador to Pakistan, accompanied the Prime Minister of Pakistan to the power generation ceremony of the first unit of the coal power plant at Port Qasim. Then, on April 24, 2018, the project reached its commercial operation date (COD).

China Eximbank agreed to 82% of the total project cost, with the Government of Pakistan covering the remaining 18%. China Eximbank provide three different loans: a RMB 2.647 billion government concessional loan (GCL), a $2.250 billion buyer’s credit loan (BCL), and a $4.001 billion preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan.
 
 The GCL carried a 1% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period. The BCL agreement [Government of Pakistan loan ID#BC-BLA201401] carried a 6% interest rate, 20 year maturity, and 8 year grace period. The PBC loan agreement [Government of Pakistan loan ID# PBC-2015-18-360] carried a 2% interest rate, a 20 year maturity, and an 8 year grace period. The Government of Pakistan provided sovereign guarantees for these loans. The GCL is captured in Project ID#41916. The BCL is captured in Project ID#41917. The PBC is captured in Project ID#41918.
 
 China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It used Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held on November 26, 2013. A major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ""cold functional tests"" began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. The project's expected completion date is in 2020.

70753,"China Eximbank approves $70.28 million preferential buyer’s credit for the Darawat Dam Project (linked to #35904)","In 2010, China Eximbank approved a preferential buyer's credit loan for the Darawat Dam Project. Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. On January 2, 2010, a groundbreaking ceremony took place for the project. The contractor (Sinohydro) mobilized to project site on June 30, 2010. The project completion ceremony took place on March 9, 2013. 
 
 The total cost of the EPC contract awarded to Sinohydro was 7.555 billion Pakistani rupees, and preferential buyer’s credits from China Eximbank cover 85% of the total cost of a project, so we estimate that the face value of the (USD-denominated) China Eximbank PBC for the Darawat Dam project was 6.42175 billion Pakistani rupee. Based on the average Pakistani rupee to USD exchange rate in 2010 (86.05 PKR = 1 USD), the estimated USD value of the preferential buyer’s credit from China Eximbank was $74,628,123. However, Pakistan's Ministry of Finance records the face value of the loan as $70,280,000. The official value is recorded as the transaction amount. 
 
 The Darawat dam is located on the Nai Baran River near Jhangri village in Jamshoro District and Sindh Province. Its locational coordinates are 25°24′33.4″N 67°56′33.3″E.

(DPPL) signed a $78.82 million loan for a 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project.The project was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. Based on DPPL’s tariff petition to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA,) the estimated terms of the ICBC loan are as follows: 11 year maturity, 1 year grace period, and 6-month LIBOR (5.4%) plus a 3% margin (or 8.4%). Dawood Power (Pvt.) Ltd. (DPPL) is a project company (special purpose vehicle) established to finance, design, and implement this 49.5 MW Wind Farm Project. HydroChina, a subsidiary of PowerChina, has a 93.89% ownership stake in Dawood Power (Pvt.) Ltd. (DPPL). 
 
 This project, which was designated as a priority infrastructure project for the Belt and Road Initiative, involved the installation of thirty three wind turbine generators (WTGs) from GoldWind, each of which generates 1.50 MW of power. It was implemented on a Build-Own-Operate (BOO) basis. DPPL signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with the Pakistan Power Grid Corporation that uses the “cost + return” method to price the electricity. The project site is located on 1,720 acres of tidal flats near near Port Qasim-Bhambore, Gharo Creek in Thatta District and Sindh Province. Northwest Institute of PowerChina — a subsidiary of the Power Construction Corporation of China — is the EPC general contractor, responsible for the project design, procurement and integration management of construction. 
 
 On January 4, 2016, ICBC announced that it disbursed the first loan disbursement (worth $25 million) for this project. The project was eventually put into commercial use on April 5, 2017 and it is currently operational. It reportedly provided 200 new jobs for local residents during its construction, and since completion, it is reportedly generating 130 million kilowatt-hours of electricity per year, which can meet 100,000 Pakistani homes’ need and ease the country’s electricity shortages.

52660,"ICBC provides $100 million loan for Sachal 49.5MW Wind Power Project (Linked to Project ID#72072)","On February 15, 2015, ICBC and Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd (SEDL) entered into a $100 million (USD-denominated) loan facility agreement for the Sachal 49.5MW MW Wind Power Project in Jhimpir, Pakistan. SEDL also entered into a 727,352,000 Pakistani rupee (PKR)-denominated loan facility agreement with ICBC-Pakistan (worth $7.134 million USD). The total cost of this independent power project (IPP) was $130.481 million and it was reportedly financed according to a debt-to-equity ratio of 80:20. Sinosure provided insurance for the USD-denominated loan. The terms of the USD-denominated loan facility agreement with ICBC were as follows: 12 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6 Month LIBOR (1.4154%) + a 3.75% margin. The terms of the PKR-denominated loan facility agreement with ICBC were as follows: 12 year maturity, 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6 Month LIBOR (1.4154%) + a 3% margin. 
 
 This project captures the USD-denominated loan and project ID#72072 captures the PKR-denominated loan. Sachal Energy Development (Ptd) Limited is a project company (special purpose vehicle), 100% owned by Arif Habib Corporation Limited, and was established to finance, design, implement, and maintain the Sachal 49.5MW Wind Power Project. The purpose of this project is to utilize wind resources for electricity generation through the construction of a wind farm with a total capacity of 49.5 MW and to deliver the electricity generated from the project to the power purchaser, i.e. National Transmission & Dispatch Company Limited (NTDC). The project involved the installation of 33 Wind Turbine Generators (WTGs) from Goldwind. Each WTG had a capacity of 1.5 MW. Hydrochina Corporation was the offshore EPC contractor and Hydrochina International Engineering Company Ltd Pakistan was the onshore EPC contractor for the project. 
 
 The project's inauguration ceremony was held on April 20, 2015. Construction began on December 11, 2015. All WTGs were installed by December 20, 2016. The purchaser and seller Interconnection facilities were energized on March 6, 2017. The project ultimately achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on April 10, 2017.
 
 Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd signed a power purchase agreement with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority in February 27, 2014, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) agreed to purchase electricity at a tariff of USD 0.14861/kWh. Compared with the Dawood Wind Power Project, also a Chinese-financed 49.5 MW wind farm with a purchase tariff of USD 0.1187/kWh, the electricity from the Sachal Wind Farm is more expensive. It is expected that the project will provide power supply to the national grid of 136,500 MWh per annum. This wind power generation project site was developed on 275 hectares of land and it is located on Jhimpir within Thatta District and Sindh Province. 
 
 STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 巴基斯坦萨察尔50MW风电项⽬. A 2013 tariff petition determination document released by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) states that the debt financing costs of the project were to be shared between China CITIC Bank (80% of debt) and Askari Bank Limited (20% of debt). However, the tariff petition was ultimately rejected, which suggests that ICBC may have become the sole foreign financier to the project.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASGULF0020150131eb2100005&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASGULF0020150306eb3800003&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/du/article.aspx/?accessionno=ASGULF0020150601eb5v00006&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=&cat=a, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/13, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cpecinfo.com/news/cpec-project-updates-april-2018/NTE5Mw==, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/Annex_III_CPEC.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://tribune.com.pk/story/1414390/sachals-wind-power-project-starts-production/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/8csdpteq2a5b3lj/2016%20Government%20of%20Pakistan%20Bond%20Prospectus.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.icap.org.pk/cpecconference/pdf/SalmanAminCPECNEPRA.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.nepra.org.pk/Tariff/Petitions/2012/Tariff%20Petition.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://na.gov.pk/uploads/documents/questions/1505734981_755.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.icbc.com.cn/icbc/en/newsupdates/icbc%20news/FirstContractedProjectunderCPECStartsCommercialOperation.htm, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://nepra.org.pk/Tariff/IPPs/Sachal%20Energy/TRF-207%20SEDPL%20Determination%20Dt.03-01-2013%2059-61.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://pk.chineseembassy.org/eng/zbgx/CPEC/t1627098.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://nepra.org.pk/Tariff/IPPs/000%20IPPs%20Wind/Sachal%20Energy/2018/TRF-207%20SEDPL%2001-06-2018%208526-28.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://nepra.org.pk/licensing/Licences/Generation/RE-2006/LAG-207%20SACHAL%20GL%2030-08-2012.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/000%20IPPs%20Wind/Sachal%20Energy/2018/TRF-207%20SEDPL%2001-06-2018%208526-28.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxrg6oox7iy3qf0/Sachal%20Wind%20Project%20Chinese.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/chbn8pp7latip1e/PDD_05.29.2015_v1.2.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.xinhuanet.com/money/2017-06/26/c_1121213746.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://ydyl.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0209/c411837-29816171.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dzf5eqxda61n6d/Sachal%20Wind%20Project%20English.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/iysa7fo1mjp7u5n/TRF-207%20SEDPL%2001-06-2018%208526-28.PDF?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzz0n6xw63kjtww/1476076504_Annual%20Report%202016large.pdf?dl=0 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/0l4cbykpzmm8xax/AHCL_Annual_Report_2018.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1433919517.8/view, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhimpir, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banbhore_Division","This project is about funding the construction of the Sachal 49.5 MW Wind Power Project in Jhimpir, Pakistan.

 The project's inauguration ceremony was held on April 20, 2015. Construction began on December 11, 2015. All WTGs were installed by December 20, 2016. The purchaser and seller Interconnection facilities were energized on March 6, 2017. The project ultimately achieved its commercial operation date (COD) on April 10, 2017. Sachal Energy Development Pvt Ltd signed a power purchase agreement with National Electric Power Regulatory Authority in February 27, 2014, and the National Transmission and Despatch Company (NTDC) agreed to purchase electricity at a tariff of USD 0.14861/kWh. Compared with the Dawood Wind Power Project, also a Chinese-financed 49.5 MW wind farm with a purchase tariff of USD 0.1187/kWh, the electricity from the Sachal Wind Farm is more expensive. It is expected that the project will provide power supply to the national grid of 136,500 MWh per annum. This wind power generation project site was developed on 275 hectares of land and it is located on Jhimpir within Thatta District and Sindh Province. 
 
 STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 巴基斯坦萨察尔50MW风电项⽬. A 2013 tariff petition determination document released by National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) states that the debt financing costs of the project were to be shared between China CITIC Bank (80% of debt) and Askari Bank Limited (20% of debt). However, the tariff petition was ultimately rejected, which suggests that ICBC may have become the sole foreign financier to the project.","https://www.dropbox.com/s/0l4cbykpzmm8xax/AHCL_Annual_Report_2018.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzz0n6xw63kjtww/1476076504_Annual%20Report%202016large.pdf?dl=0 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/iysa7fo1mjp7u5n/TRF-207%20SEDPL%2001-06-2018%208526-28.PDF?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/8dzf5eqxda61n6d/Sachal%20Wind%20Project%20English.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://ydyl.people.com.cn/n1/2018/0209/c411837-29816171.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.xinhuanet.com/money/2017-06/26/c_1121213746.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/chbn8pp7latip1e/PDD_05.29.2015_v1.2.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/wxrg6oox7iy3qf0/Sachal%20Wind%20Project%20Chinese.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://nepra.org.pk/tariff/Tariff/IPPs/000%20IPPs%20Wind/Sachal%20Energy/2018/TRF-207%20SEDPL%2001-06-2018%208526-28.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://nepra.org.pk/licensing/Licences/Generation/RE-2006/LAG-207%20SACHAL%20GL%2030-08-2012.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/bzz0n6xw63kjtww/1476076504_Annual%20Report%202016large.pdf?dl=0 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/DB/RWTUV1433919517.8/view, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jhimpir, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banbhore_Division","This project is about funding the construction of the Sachal 49.5 MW Wind Power Project in Jhimpir, Pakistan.

The project is reportedly being implemented on a public-private partnership (PPP) basis.
 
 The Nai Gaj Dam Project is a dam across the Gaj river in the gorge area at the edge of Kirthar range about 65 km (40 miles) northwest of Dadu city in Sindh Province. Its locational coordinates are 26°52′32″N 67°19′14″E. With the construction of the proposed dam, it was envisaged that the flood waters of Gaj river would be stored in a reservoir, which would be annually available for developing 40,000 acres of irrigated agriculture. It was also envisaged that this project would produce 4.2 MW of power generation and that the damming of Gaj River would save the flood water for irrigated agriculture development, power generation, water supply for drinking and other domestic uses and fresh water for Manchar Lake. 
 
 NEIE-SMADB-LILLY-RMS joint venture (JV) was selected as the contractor responsible for project implementation on January 13, 2011. Construction then began in May 2012. Around 51% of the construction work was completed as of 2018. However, this project has encountered major delays and cost increases. Its expected completion date is in mid-2022. This project has also faced accusations of corruption and financial irregularities.

 The independent power plant project (IPP) is located at Thar Block II, 25 kilometers from the city of Islamkot, near the village of Singharo-Bitra in the district of Tharparkar with Sindh Province. Thar Block II is a 95.5 square kilometer (km2) area of the Thar coalfield, which has total lignite reserves of 175 billion tons which can be utilized to produce 100,000 megawatt (MW) for over 200 years. The project will be fueled by coal supplied by Sindh Engro Coal Mining Company (SECMC), which is developing a coal mine of 3.8 million tonnes per annum capacity beside the project (see Project ID#54315). 
 
 The total estimated cost of the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II coal power project is $1.1. billion and the project is being financed with 75% debt and 25% equity. In December 2014, ICBC’s Karachi Branch submitted an initial expression of interest to provide $825 million of debt financing for the power project. Then, a set of financing agreements were signed in Beijing on December 21, 2015 for both the power plant project (this project) and the mining project (see Project ID#54315). Under these agreements with EPTL, the 2 X 330 MW Engro Thar Block II coal power project project was supported by a Pakistani rupee-denominated syndicated facility agreement from HBL, United Bank Limited, Bank Alfalah Limited, Askari Bank Limited, Soneri Bank Limited, Sindh Bank Limited, Bank of Punjab, MCB Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited, Pak Oman Investment Company Limited, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, National Bank of Pakistan and Pak Brunei Investment Company Limited worth 17,016,000,000 Pakistan rupees; a bilateral facility agreement with National Bank of Pakistan worth 3,134,000,000 Pakstani rupees; and islamic facility agreements with three banks — Meezan Bank Limited, Faysal Bank Limited and Habib Bank Limited — worth 4,000,000,000 Pakistani rupees. 
 
 All of these loans are repayable in 20 semi-annual installments commencing from the earlier of (i) first fixed date falling after 48 months since facility effective date and (ii) second fixed date falling after Commercial Operations Date (COD); where fixed dates are defined as First June or First December of any year and carries interest at the rate of 3 months KIBOR plus 3.5%. 
 
 On December 21, 2015, EPTL also signed a $621 million syndicated loan facility agreement with China Development Bank, China Construction Bank and ICBC (with each bank contributing $207 million). The terms of the syndicated loan facility from China Development Bank, China Construction Bank and ICBC are as follows: 14 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR (0.485%) plus a 4.2% margin. Sinosure provided insurance for this loan. A sovereign guarantee was also provided. The total equity requirement of the project is $275 million, and the majority of the equity investment was expected to come from EPTL and its affiliates. CMEC was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. The project reached its commercial operation date (COD) on July 10, 2019.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=paprin0020010714dx6p00q6v&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020041203e0c100078&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020041019e0ag0000o&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CWI0000020050808e17p0000o&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PAPRIN0020060119e21i0004k&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=CWI0000020061127e2bd0000u&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://sindhcoal.gos.pk/projects/jv-project-between-gos-engro-group-block-ii/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tribune.com.pk/story/596701/raising-finance-sino-sindh-resources-gets-investment-to-develop-thar/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php/Pakistan_and_coal#China_to_invest_in_Thar, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dawn.com/news/1145855, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/national/26-Oct-2014/thar-coal-project-chinese-banks-reluctant-to-accept-sovereign-guarantees, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://sindhcoal.gos.pk/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/vults7c3kv89j45/BU_PITCH_ENGLISH_2018.xlsx?dl=0, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://cpec.gov.pk/project-details/3, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cpecinfo.com/energy-generation, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cpecinfo.com/news/cpec-project-updates-april-2018/NTE5Mw==, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://dukespace.lib.duke.edu/dspace/bitstream/handle/10161/16605/MP%20CR%20TS%20XW.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.finance.gov.pk/survey/chapters_17/Annex_III_CPEC.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/8csdpteq2a5b3lj/2016%20Government%20of%20Pakistan%20Bond%20Prospectus.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www3.hkexnews.hk/listedco/listconews/sehk/2015/0428/ltn20150428394.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwixypDGuIrhAhWQjFkKHeV2BXMQFjABegQICRAB&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.decatalanen.nl%2F17218_tunnel%2Fmining%2Fof%2Fcoal%2Fin%2Fpakistan.html&usg=AOvVaw2ShPqPaeLIDmL0CQI_CUzl, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASMESG0020170911ed990000h&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/28cu9raxpeurls3/A%20Historic%20Milestone%20for%20Mining%20and%20Power%20Projects%20in%20Thar%20Block%20II%20_%20Engro%20Corporation%20Limited_.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://profit.pakistantoday.com.pk/2019/07/09/engro-realises-promise-of-indigenous-power-production-for-pakistan/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dailyparliamenttimes.com/2019/07/23/thar-coal-power-plant-starts-660mw-commercial-operations/#.XpYHDZNKi_I, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/z4oun3njlyyzbhx/engro-corp-annual-report-2018.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://pk.china-embassy.org/eng/zbgx/t1627106.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Engro+Coal+Mines,+Thar+Block+II+Sindh/@24.7750235,70.3953551,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x394f8d528ac1413f:0x3e3a9e41c85adb9b!8m2!3d24.7750235!4d70.3975438

In January 2017, Pakistan's Under Communications Division provided 120 million Pakistani rupees for the Zhob Mughal Kot road. The division also contributed 40 million Pakistani rupees for the rehabilitation of DI Khan Mughal Kot road. As of Nov 2018, CPEC website only indicates that Feasibility and PC-I have been completed and the LOI has been forwarded to Chinese side. No other progress is indicated. A second CPEC website puts the project cost at US$195 million. It also suggests that the project is an 'upgradation of D.I.Khan - Zhob Phase I.'

This project involve the construction of two 660MW supercritical coal-fired units, with synchronous installation of high-efficiency electrostatic precipitator and flue gas desulfurization facilities. Huaneng Shandong Ruyi (Pakistan) Energy Ltd. is the project company (or special purpose vehicle) that was established by its sponsor/shareholders — Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co. Ltd. (51% ownership stake) and Shandong Ruyi Science & Technology Group (49% ownership stake) — to assume responsibility for the development, investment and management the two 660MW coal-fired units in Sahiwal. 
 
 The total cost of the project was approximately $1.808 billion and it was implemented on a build, operate, transfer (BOT) basis, in which the power plant's ownership will be transferred to the Government of Punjab after 30 years of operation. The project was financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 75:25. This project captures the debt financing that supported the project. The estimated terms of the syndicated buyer’s credit loan are as follows: 14 year maturity, 4 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.45%) plus a 4.5% margin (or 4.95%). Sinosure provided insurance for this buyer’s credit loan. For details on the equity portion, see project ID#54134. 
 
 In March 2014, the Government of Punjab issued invitation for bids for six 2x660MW coal-fired power development projects. By May 2014, the consortium of Huaneng Shandong Power Generation Co., Ltd., its subsidiary in Hong Kong, and Shandong Ruyi Technology Group Co., Ltd., had officially obtained the right to develop Sahiwal 2x660MW coal-fired power project. The project site is located about 12 miles from Sahiwal and 9.3 miles from Okara cantonment, just north of the road which connects the two towns, in Pakistan's Punjab Province. Its exact locational coordinates are 30°42′55″N 73°14′20″E. The site spans 690 hectares and it was given by the Pakistani government free of charge.

Then, on December 5, 2012, China’s Ambassador to Pakistan, Liu Jian, attended the signing ceremony for the Post Flood Rehabilitation Project. The project involved the rehabilitation of 460 kilometers of road along the N-35, N-5, N-55 highways that were damaged by floods. 
 
 According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division (Fiscal Year 2015/16 Yearbook), the Chinese Government provided an RMB 1,273,000,000 grant for this project. China Railway 17th Bureau Co., Ltd. and China Yunnan Sunshine Road Bridge Co., Ltd. were the contractors responsible for project implementation. Approximately $65 million of the proceeds from this grant agreement were set aside for the rehabilitation and improvement of the Thakot-Raikot Section (N-35) of the Karakoram Highway. 
 
 This sub-project commenced on September 15, 2013 and its planned completed date was December 20, 2016. China Railway 17th Bureau Group Co.

This loan carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and a 2.5% interest rate. This project involved the acquisition of 24 mobile scanners in an effort to strengthen security arrangements and fight terrorism. These scanners are designed to detect explosives and weapons. However, this project was plagued by various problems and delays. In 2010, the Pakistani authorities delayed the installation of the x-ray scanners in Islamabad after experts declared them 'a health hazard' due to high radiation levels. Then, after some scanners arrived in Karachi, they could not be brought to Islamabad until December 2014 due to a dispute over the payment of customs duties. This project reached completion, but its exact date of completion is unknown.

The system aims to provide a constant power supply to one of the city's key recreational attractions at a time when power cuts remain a major problem due to shortfalls on the grid. The solar installation, which produces 870 kilowatts of electricity ─ enough to power the equivalent of 450 homes ─ runs water pumps and sprinkler systems for the park, and provides power for the offices of the Islamabad Metropolitan Corporation (IMC) and Capital Development Authority (CDA), both located within the park. 
 
 The initiative, financed with a RMB 33.1 million grant from the Chinese government, uses batteries to store solar energy to meet lighting and other electricity needs 24 hours a day. The project was officially completed and handed over to the the National Assembly Secretariat on December 15, 2016. China Railways 17th Bureau Group was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It completed the project two months before its date on completion. The plant has an installed capacity of 0.85 MW, which will be used to power streetlights in the park, lights in the children’s play area, the tennis court, cricket ground and a tube well installed in the park. China Railways 17th Bureau Group is also responsible for maintaining the plant for five years. The plant is comprised of 3,400 solar panels.

Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on April 20, 2015, a commercial contract for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project was signed between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)]. 
 
 Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2015, the China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement, a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement, and an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement. The BCL (Project ID#53820 and loan ID#BC-OLL-2015) has a 5.2% interest rate, 2 year grace period, and a 20 year maturity. The PBC (Project ID#37280 and loan ID#PBC-OLL15-34377) has a 20 year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The GCL (Project ID#54420 and loan ID#GCL-OLL15-20559) has a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of this “mixed credit” from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017. 
 
 The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays. 
 
 The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

37280,"China Export-Import Bank commits Preferential Buyer's Credit of US$1.23 billion to Pakistan for Lahore Orange Line Metro Train project (linked to project #53820, #57673, and #54420)","On April 27, 2011, the Government of Pakistan first announced its interest in pursuing a project to develop a city-wide train system in the eastern city of Lahore. Lahore, the capital of Punjab province, is Pakistan’s most populous and prosperous province, with more than 5 million people. Pakistani officials expected the new transport system, the first of its kind in the country, to substantially decrease road traffic. Then, on April 20, 2015, a commercial contract for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: was signed between Punjab Mass Transit Authority (PMA) and CR-NORINCO [a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO)]. 
 
 Shortly thereafter, on December 21, 2015, the China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed three separate loan agreements for the Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project: a $203.25 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement, a $1,235,480,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement, and an RMB 1,200,000,000 government concessional loan (GCL) loan agreement. The BCL (Project ID#53820 and loan ID#BC-OLL-2015) has a 5.2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. The PBC (Project ID#37280 and loan ID#PBC-OLL15-34377) has a 20 year maturity and an unknown interest rate. The GCL (Project ID#54420 and loan ID#GCL-OLL15-20559) has a 2% interest rate and a 20 year maturity. According to the Government of Pakistan’s Economic Affairs Division, $672.7 million of this “mixed credit” from China Eximbank had been disbursed as of June 30, 2017. 
 
 The Lahore Orange Line Metro Train Project involved the construction of a 27km two-lane metro bus corridor runs through the heart of Lahore along Multan Road, McLeod Road, and GT Road. Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. 
 
 Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

The communication satellite was to be constructed with 30 year transponders, 12 in C-Band and 18 in Ku-Band, each of 36 MHz Bandwidth. Then, in September 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a framework agreement. Under the terms of the framework agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide up to RMB 1.385 billion for the Paksat-1R Project. Any subsidiary loans under this framework agreement would bear the following terms: a 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. 
 
 Shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2009, Deputy Director of the China Eximbank and the Pakistani Ambassador to China signed a RMB 800 million loan agreement for the Paksat-1R Project (Project ID#43298). China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan also signed an RMB 86.5 million loan agreement for the construction of a ground control facility on October 27, 2010 (see Project ID #36953). Paksat-1R, a DFH-4-type satellite, was constructed by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). 
 
 On August 12, 2011, at the Chinese Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Pakistan’s first Communications Satellite PAKSAT-1R, as part of Pakistan’s Space Programme 2040, was launched. The launch was witnessed by Pakistani Secretary Defence Lt Gen Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the Paksat-1R satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. 
 
 The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38° East. The commercial services of the satellite were inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on November 5, 2011 from the satellite ground station located near Lahore. On November 11, 2011, the ground control center was transferred to the Pakistani side for its use.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASGULF0020101115e6be0001d&cat=a&ep=ASE, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=ASBUSN0020101101e6at0000c&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PRTRIN0020101101e6at000um&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=NBBALU0020101228e6cr0001j&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=PRTRIN0020101229e6cr0010c&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=AIWBUR0020101228e6ct0003l&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tune.pk/video/3365149/official-video-suparco-paksat-1r-launching-pakistan-first-communications-satellite, Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs; http://www.suparco.gov.pk/pages/paksat1r.asp, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/08/china-debuts-partnership-pakistan-long-march-launches-paksat-1r/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://nation.com.pk/Politics/30-Oct-2010/China-provides-loan-for-satellite-ground-control-segment, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-6138-China-backs-Pak-moves-to-safeguard-its-security, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tribune.com.pk/story/415738/lagging-behind-2040-pakistans-space-oddyssey/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://junshi.xilu.com/2011/0524/news_44_160029.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://gb.cri.cn/27824/2009/09/18/2225s2626360.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cn.cgwic.com/In-OrbitDelivery/CommunicationsSatellite/Program/PakSat-1R.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.dawn.com/news/577205/pak-china-sign-loan-agreement-for-satellite-ground-control-segment, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.pakistaneconomist.com/pagesearch/Search-Engine2009/S.E652.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=AIWNAT0020110429e74t0000u&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/09/09/china-pakistan-space-technology-cooperation/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://preview.pk2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/chinanews/201011/20101107219637.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cn.cgwic.com/PakSat-1R/dashiji20110812.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/dl/gbdqzn/upload/bajisitan.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cn.cgwic.com/PakSat-1R/english/focus.html#, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.china.org.cn/2009-09/18/content_18554894.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://web.archive.org/web/20101102203341/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/30-Oct-2010/China-provides-loan-for-satellite-ground-control-segment, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paksat-1R, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://suparco.gov.pk/downloadables/nsc23.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2011/08/china-debuts-partnership-pakistan-long-march-launches-paksat-1r/; https://tribune.com.pk/story/415738/lagging-behind-2040-pakistans-space-oddyssey","Coded the Lahore District since a few articles mention Lahore as a ground station and the location details gives Lahore and no other information contradicted this","good","district",73.94,31.21,"Lahore","Division","PAK.7.5_1","Pakistan"

37131,"China Eximbank contributes $60 million USD to syndicated buyer's credit loan (BCL) for the 425 MW Nandipur Power Plant in Pakistan","On March 19, 2009, a syndicate of banks (including HSBC, China Eximbank, and BNP Paribas) signed a $150.151 million syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with Northern Power Generation Company Ltd for construction of 425 MW Combined Cycle Power Project at Nandipur. The syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement had a 10 year maturity and it was insured by Sinosure. China Eximbank contributed approximately $60 million through a USD-denominated loan tranche and a Euro-denominated loan tranche. 
 
 Northern Power Generation Company Ltd (NPGCL) is the biggest thermal generation company operating under the overall management of Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO). NPGCL constructed the 425 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant at Nandipur, Nandipur near Gujranwala in the Punjab Province. The main EPC contractor was Dongfang Electric Corporation Ltd with G.E. France serving as a subcontractor. Construction began on October 16, 2008. However, the project was plagued by delays and controversy. In January 2008, under a provision of the 18th amendment, the Government of Punjab, Pakistan signed a $329 million EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation of China to construct the Nandipur Power Project and paid a 10% down payment. Then, a conflict between the Ministry of Water and Power and the Ministry of Law and Justice delayed the project execution for two years from March 2010 to March 2012. 
 
 The Ministry of Law and Justice raised an objection over a violation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and the granting of the contract to China Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was blacklisted; the ministry further refused to vet the permissions before issuing an explanation of procedures. As a result, machinery worth $85 million remained stuck at the Karachi Port for over two years. In September 2012, the president of Dongfang Electric Corporation, Zhang Guorong, terminated the contract for the construction of the Nandipur Power Project, saying his company had suffered losses worth $85 million. 
 
 In June 2013, Pakistan's Ministry of Water and Power started renegotiating the contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation to resume work on the Nandipur Power Project. After successful negotiations, the firm agreed to resume work on the power station. On July 8, 2013, engineers of Dongfang Electric Corporation arrived in Karachi to inspect the machinery lying at the Karachi Port and to secure its release. Later, work on the project was restarted at an escalated cost. 
 
 After several delays, the project was finally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif on May 31, 2014. However, the plant remained operational for only five days after the inauguration and had to be shut down due to mismanagement, conflicts with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) over high production costs, and the use of inappropriate fuel. Since then, the plant has faced several controversies and operational failures, yielding inquiries and probes into misappropriations within the project. Ultimately, the energy produced by the Nandipur power plant was extremely expensive and the project was shut down after five days of operation.

35266,"China Eximbank provides $448 buyer’s credit loan for the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (Linked to project #54087) (non-CPEC, IPP)","On May 22, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $448 million buyer’s credit loan agreement [ID# CN-BCL-2013-01] for the 969MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) is a project company that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, which is a 969 MW run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. 
 
 The project was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. The project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually. 
 
 According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submited to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) is being financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounts to PKR 401,416 million Pakistani rupees (PKR), which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Foreign sources of debt financing include $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development, and $1.024 billion from China Eximbank. 
 
 Two separate loans were secured from China Eximbank: a $448 million China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan (this record) in 2013 and a $576 million preferential buyer’s credit loan (Project ID#54087) in 2016. The terms of the buyer’s credit loan (BCL) were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.409%) plus a 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the BCL to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 15%. The terms of the preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.058%) plus 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. 
 
 The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the PBC loan to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 12%. As of June 30 2017, the PBC loan had been fully disbursed and the $191.067 million of the BCL had been disbursed. The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium called CGGC-CMEC. It was comprised of Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. 
 
 In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. Project implementation then began on February 9, 2008. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The project was expected to achieve its commercial operation date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid. This project was also plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.

37236,"Syndicate of Chinese banks provides $1.6 billion buyer’s credit loan for 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project (Linked to project #54014) [CPEC]","In 2017, a group of Chinese banks (including China Development Bank) signed a $1,642,300,000 syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with Kohala Hydro Company (Private) Limited (KHCL) for the 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project. Kohala Hydro Company (Private) Limited (KHCL) is a project company (or special purpose vehicle) responsible for financing, designing, implementation, and maintaining the 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project. KHCL has a single shareholder: China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Ltd (CSAIL), which is an investment holding company formed by China Three Gorges Corporation on September 30, 2011 in the Cayman Islands to acquire, develop, build, own and operate renewable power generation projects in Pakistan. 
 
 The 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project is part of China–Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) initiative and it is being implemented on a Build-Own-Operate-Transfer (BOOT) basis and financed with a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. The total project cost is $2,760,170,000,000. A syndicate of Chinese banks is covering 85% ($1,642,300,000) of the total cost of the debt financing for the project ($1,932,120,000). The terms of the syndicated buyer’s credit loan agreement with China Development Bank and other Chinese banks are as follows: 18.5 year maturity, 6.5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.6%) plus a 4.60% margin. A syndicate of local Pakistani banks is covering 15% of the total cost of the debt financing for the project. 
 
 The remaining cost of the project is to be covered through an $828.05 equity contribution from CSAIL. To date, a $31.03 million equity contribution has been injected in KHCL by CSAIL (see project #54014). The 1124 MW Kohala Hydropower Project consists of a dam on River Jhelum, with twin 17.4 km long headrace tunnels which will end in the power house downstream on the River Jhelum. The curved concrete gravity dam with a crest elevation of 910 m, will have a maximum height of 69 meters and a top length of 270 meters. The main power station will be equipped with 4 vertical Francis turbine generator units, each of which has a capacity of 275 MW. An additional 24 MW will run on the ecological flow of the river downstream of the dam. The dam site is located in Siran Village on the Jhelum River, about 3 km downstream of the Kohala Bridge. The power plant is located in Barsala in District Muzafarabad. The catchment area of the dam site is 14,060 km2, with an average annual discharge of 302 m3/s and average annual runoff is 9.52 billion m3. The total installed capacity of the hydropower station will be 1,124 MW, comprising 1,100 MW installed capacity for the main power station and 24 MW (2 x 12 MW) installed capacity for the ecological flow power station. 
 
 A consortium of Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co. Ltd, & China Three Gorges Project Development Co. Ltd was selected as the EPC contractor. Project construction began on September 6, 2018 and the project is expected to reach its commercial operation date (COD) on December 31, 2025. The project company will eventually sell all of the power that it generates to a Pakistani state-owned enterprise — called Central Power Purchasing Agency (Guarantee) Limited — under a 30-year power purchase agreement (PPA).

37233,"Chinese Banks loan 945 Million USD for 720 MW Karot hydropower project (Linked to project #54012, #53675, and #54317) (BRI, CPEC, IPP)","Karot Power Company (KPCL) obtained a letter of interest early in May 2007 from the Private Power Infrastructure Board (PPIB) to develop the Karot Hydropower Project. In October 2009, the PPIB approved the Feasibility Study Report of the project and in November 2013, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority granted KPCL a generation license to develop a 720 MW hydro-based generation facility at Karot village, District Rawalpindi, in Punjab province. The project is located on Jhelum River, near Karot Bridge. It is the 4th among 5 Cascade HPPs to be developed along Jhelum River. KPCL is 93% owned by China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation, and 7% owned by Pakistan's Associated Technologies. On January 9, 2015, KPCL completed a EPC Tender evaluation and awarded the EPC contract to Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation Consortium. The project will be undertaken on a build-own-operate-transfer basis. Construction began in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2021. The project is designated a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and a flagship project under Belt and Road Initiative. Project is part of the $2 billion Karot power projects, focusing on hydro and wind power, under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor reported to be completed by 2018. The project will feature a single power generation complex with an installed capacity will be 720-megawatts with four units of 180-megawatts each. The power structure layout will include a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project itself is distributed as 80% in Punjab (powerhouse) and 20% in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (reservoirs). According to an interview with the chief accountant from China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, the total cost of the project is 1.75 billion USD, with a debt-equity ratio of 80:20. The project achieved financial closure on February 22, 2017. According to IJGlobal, the 80% debt component was financed by loans from China Development Bank, China Exim Bank, China Silk Road Fund and International Finance Corporation (IFC), each one worth 315 Million USD, along with an additional 100 Million USD loan from IFC. This project records the loans from the Chinese banks. For the equity component, China Three Gorges Corporation invested 316.20 Million USD, while Associated technologies invested 23.90 Million USD (captured in #54012). Sinosure provided loan insurance for the Chinese bank loans. The IMF puts the loan interest rate at 5.11%, with a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 5 years. It was additionally reported that there is a 30-year concession period. On April 20, 2015, China's $40 billion Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding with China Three Gorges Corporation and the PPIB on the development of Pakistan's hydropower project, pledging to finance the project through equity investment in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, and participating in a loan syndicate made up of Chinese banks. As of 2017, the Silk Road Fund has disbursed 1.65 Billion USD. The Silk Road Fund also owns 15% of China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Company as of 2017. On March 14, 2017, IFC announced that it will invest $100 million in the Karot Hydropower Project, and reported that it acquired a 15% stake in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited in 2015. IFC stated that this investment is its first major collaboration with the China Export Import Bank, China Development Bank, and Silk Road Fund. The first unit is projected to begin power generation in 2020, coming online prior to its deadline. The Chinese firm in charge of the project will hand over this project to Pakistani government after the 30-year concession period has ended.

54087,"China Eximbank provides $576 million preferential buyer's credit for the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (Linked to project #35266) (non-CPEC, IPP)","On September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $576 million preferential buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) is a project company that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, which is a 969 MW run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. 
 
 The project was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of Chatter Kalas. The project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually. According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounts to PKR 401,416 million Pakistani rupees (PKR), which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Foreign sources of debt financing include $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development, and $1.024 billion from China Eximbank. 
 
 Two separate loans were secured from China Eximbank: a $448 million China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan (this record) in 2013 and a $576 million preferential buyer’s credit loan (Project ID#54087) in 2016. The terms of the buyer’s credit loan (BCL) were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.409%) plus a 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the BCL to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 15%. The terms of the preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.058%) plus 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the PBC loan to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 12%. As of June 30, 2017, the PBC loan had been fully disbursed and the $191.067 million of the BCL had been disbursed. 
 
 The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium called CGGC-CMEC. It was comprised of Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. Project implementation then began on February 9, 2008. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The project was expected to achieve its commercial operation date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid. This project was also plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.

35122,"China Export-Import Bank commits supplier's credit of US$102 million to Pakistan for white oil pipeline","In 2002, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) provided a $102 million supplier's credit to Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) for the White Oil Pipeline Project. Pak-Arab Pipeline Company (PARCO/PAPCO) and China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation (CPECC) signed an agreement, under which the Chinese firm would supply equipment and materials for the construction of white oil pipeline from Port Qasim, Karachi to Mahmud Kot, Multan. 
 
 This project involved the construction of a 786 km, 26-inch diameter, high-speed diesel oil pipeline that runs from Karachi to Mahmoodkot. A joint venture company (special purpose vehicle) called Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) was created to finance, design, implement, and maintain this project. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. (PARCO ) -- a joint venture company between Government of Pakistan and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi -- holds a 51% majority share in PAPCO, while Shell, PSO and TOTAL PARCO Marketing Limited hold 26%, 12% and 11% equity shares, respectively. 
 
 On August 7, 2001, Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) signed an EPC contract with the China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation – Techno (Pvt) Ltd. Consortium. The total cost of the project was $480 million and it was implemented according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio ($120 million of equity and $360 million of debt financing). 
 
 The project reached financial close in 2002, with China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) providing a $102 supplier's credit and local banks providing additional debt financing to PAPCO. In order to provide this supplier credit to PAPCO, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) secured a $102 million export seller's credit facility with a 10-year maturity from China Eximbank. 
 
 The $481 million project would provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for both crude and refined products transportation and added with the completion of the pipeline a more comprehensive, safer, cost effective, demand responsive and eco-friendly pipeline network will be available to meet the country’s growing needs for energy. The 817 km-long and 26 inch diameter pipeline has an initial capacity of transporting eight million tons refined petroleum products, and 12 million tons white oil per annum. 
 
 The project groundbreaking ceremony was on May 31, 2001. The project reached its commercial operation date on March 1, 2005. It was official inaugurated on completed on August 26, 2005. 
 
 Out of the total cost of $481 million, the foreign component stands at $120 million, while local component stands at Rs 20.657 billion. The debt part of the foreign currency cost is being financed by export credit agencies (ECAs) from China through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor. Three major banks — HBL, UBL and NBP—will arrange Rs12.5 billion of Rs29 billion White Oil Pipeline Project of PAPCO. Around Rs10 billion would be floated as TFCs (term finance certificates) and the remaining amount would be in the form of redeemable preference shares. The financing arrangement also includes bridge financing of Rs5 billion by the consortium banks to be made available for the project. In this regard, a meeting of the chief executives of NBP, HBL, UBL and PAPCO was held at the NBP office and memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also signed. The Rs29 billion ($480 million) white oil pipeline project is achieving financial close and the entire debt financing of $360 million including Rs12.5 billion in local currency is being arranged whereas equity financing of $120 million is in place. For this project NBP will also provide a foreign currency loan of $18 million and issue a bank guarantee of $102 million for China Exim Bank related to suppliers’ credit from CPECC, which have been selected as EPC contractor for the project.
 
 STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 在巴基斯坦成品油管线项目. Note that China Eximbank offers export seller’s credits to Chinese companies that are implementing overseas projects. These companies may, in turn, use the proceeds of an export seller's credit to make equity investments or provide loans to the host government or other entities in the host country. In this case, China Eximbank provided a $102 million export seller's credit to China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC), and CPECC then used the proceeds of the export seller's credit to lend to PAPCO. Also, note that one source identifies the face value of the export seller's credit facility as $120 million.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=bbcsap0020010710dx5b001qv&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=afpr000020010709dx5b02y72&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dawn.com/news/30107/banks-to-fund-white-oil-pipeline-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050105005528/en/American-Energy-Announces-Purchase-Working-Interest-Pakistan#.VZ1cBu2qqko, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.gasandoil.com/news/south_east_asia/ba5dcb7c34cfdf41b5e3754470e8f49f, Other; http://karachi2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralvisits/200508/20050800298350.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://dar.dargroup.com/Projects/White-Oil-Pipeline-Project-WOPP, Other; https://www.parco.com.pk/our-business/transportation/pipeline-network/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=1249358&language=en , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://papco.com.pk/white-oil-pipeline-system/milestones/ , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://papco.com.pk/white-oil-pipeline-system/key-project-information/ , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/b/20050829/09311924123.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpecc.cnpc.com.cn/cpecc/chuyun1xmxx/201205/d1bff6591fbf439cb42a4733efe0cf59.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.gem.wiki/White_Oil_Pipeline, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinaqw.com/news/200905/06/162146.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://fp.brecorder.com/2005/08/20050826316636/ , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.scribd.com/document/292712576/WOPP-Syndication , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dawn.com/news/13558/chinese-firm-to-get-govt-financial-guarantee-white-oil-pipeline-project , Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs","https://www.parco.com.pk/our-business/transportation/pipeline-network/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Oil_Pipeline, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Qasim","Sindh Province was coded in this row.

35122,"China Export-Import Bank commits supplier's credit of US$102 million to Pakistan for white oil pipeline","In 2002, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) provided a $102 million supplier's credit to Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) for the White Oil Pipeline Project. Pak-Arab Pipeline Company (PARCO/PAPCO) and China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation (CPECC) signed an agreement, under which the Chinese firm would supply equipment and materials for the construction of white oil pipeline from Port Qasim, Karachi to Mahmud Kot, Multan. 
 
 This project involved the construction of a 786 km, 26-inch diameter, high-speed diesel oil pipeline that runs from Karachi to Mahmoodkot. A joint venture company (special purpose vehicle) called Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) was created to finance, design, implement, and maintain this project. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. (PARCO ) -- a joint venture company between Government of Pakistan and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi -- holds a 51% majority share in PAPCO, while Shell, PSO and TOTAL PARCO Marketing Limited hold 26%, 12% and 11% equity shares, respectively. 
 
 On August 7, 2001, Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) signed an EPC contract with the China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation – Techno (Pvt) Ltd. Consortium. The total cost of the project was $480 million and it was implemented according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio ($120 million of equity and $360 million of debt financing). 
 
 The project reached financial close in 2002, with China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) providing a $102 supplier's credit and local banks providing additional debt financing to PAPCO. In order to provide this supplier credit to PAPCO, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) secured a $102 million export seller's credit facility with a 10-year maturity from China Eximbank. 
 
 The $481 million project would provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for both crude and refined products transportation and added with the completion of the pipeline a more comprehensive, safer, cost effective, demand responsive and eco-friendly pipeline network will be available to meet the country’s growing needs for energy. The 817 km-long and 26 inch diameter pipeline has an initial capacity of transporting eight million tons refined petroleum products, and 12 million tons white oil per annum. 
 
 The project groundbreaking ceremony was on May 31, 2001. The project reached its commercial operation date on March 1, 2005. It was official inaugurated on completed on August 26, 2005. 
 
 Out of the total cost of $481 million, the foreign component stands at $120 million, while local component stands at Rs 20.657 billion. The debt part of the foreign currency cost is being financed by export credit agencies (ECAs) from China through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor. Three major banks — HBL, UBL and NBP—will arrange Rs12.5 billion of Rs29 billion White Oil Pipeline Project of PAPCO. Around Rs10 billion would be floated as TFCs (term finance certificates) and the remaining amount would be in the form of redeemable preference shares. The financing arrangement also includes bridge financing of Rs5 billion by the consortium banks to be made available for the project. In this regard, a meeting of the chief executives of NBP, HBL, UBL and PAPCO was held at the NBP office and memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also signed. The Rs29 billion ($480 million) white oil pipeline project is achieving financial close and the entire debt financing of $360 million including Rs12.5 billion in local currency is being arranged whereas equity financing of $120 million is in place. For this project NBP will also provide a foreign currency loan of $18 million and issue a bank guarantee of $102 million for China Exim Bank related to suppliers’ credit from CPECC, which have been selected as EPC contractor for the project.
 
 STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese project title is 在巴基斯坦成品油管线项目. Note that China Eximbank offers export seller’s credits to Chinese companies that are implementing overseas projects. These companies may, in turn, use the proceeds of an export seller's credit to make equity investments or provide loans to the host government or other entities in the host country. In this case, China Eximbank provided a $102 million export seller's credit to China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC), and CPECC then used the proceeds of the export seller's credit to lend to PAPCO. Also, note that one source identifies the face value of the export seller's credit facility as $120 million.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=bbcsap0020010710dx5b001qv&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=afpr000020010709dx5b02y72&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dawn.com/news/30107/banks-to-fund-white-oil-pipeline-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20050105005528/en/American-Energy-Announces-Purchase-Working-Interest-Pakistan#.VZ1cBu2qqko, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.gasandoil.com/news/south_east_asia/ba5dcb7c34cfdf41b5e3754470e8f49f, Other; http://karachi2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/bilateralvisits/200508/20050800298350.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://dar.dargroup.com/Projects/White-Oil-Pipeline-Project-WOPP, Other; https://www.parco.com.pk/our-business/transportation/pipeline-network/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.kuna.net.kw/ArticleDetails.aspx?id=1249358&language=en , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://papco.com.pk/white-oil-pipeline-system/milestones/ , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://papco.com.pk/white-oil-pipeline-system/key-project-information/ , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://finance.sina.com.cn/chanjing/b/20050829/09311924123.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cpecc.cnpc.com.cn/cpecc/chuyun1xmxx/201205/d1bff6591fbf439cb42a4733efe0cf59.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.gem.wiki/White_Oil_Pipeline, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinaqw.com/news/200905/06/162146.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://fp.brecorder.com/2005/08/20050826316636/ , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.scribd.com/document/292712576/WOPP-Syndication , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dawn.com/news/13558/chinese-firm-to-get-govt-financial-guarantee-white-oil-pipeline-project , Social Media, including Unofficial Blogs","https://www.parco.com.pk/our-business/transportation/pipeline-network/, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_Oil_Pipeline, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mehmood_Kot","Punjab Province is coded in this row.

Under the agreement, China Eximbank agreed to provide export seller’s credits to cover 87.5% of the financial requirements of the supplier credits that two Chinese firms would offer to Pakistan Railways (PR). The remaining 12.5% would be arranged by Pakistan Railways. The terms of the lending package were as follows: 18 year maturity, 3 year grace period, and an interest rate of approximately 5%. 
 
 China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation agreed to sell 175 passenger carriages to PR, while Dongfang Electric Corporation (DEC) agreed to sell 69 modern locomotive engines to PR (with 15 locomotives being manufactured in China and the remaining 54 being assembled in Pakistan). China was to provide both spare parts and technology. According to a 2003 China Eximbank annual report, it agreed in March of 2003 to provide RMB 650 million (roughly the equivalent of $100 million at the conversion rate of the time) in export seller’s credits to China National Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation. Then, in July of 2003, its two export seller’s credits to Donfang Electric Corporation worth RMB 680 million and $4.6 million, respectively, to support the firm’s sale and export of 69 locomotives to PR. 
 
 This project captures the $4.6 million supplier credit from Donfang Electric Corporation for the acquisition of 69 locomotives. For details of the RMB 680 million supplier credit from Donfang Electric Corporation, see project #56551. For details of the other supplier credit from CMC involving the acquisition railway coaches, see project #35120. These are linked together because they were signed and implemented simultaneously.

Any subsidiary loans under this framework agreement would bear the following terms: a 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, and a 5 year grace period. 
 
 Shortly thereafter, on October 15, 2009, Deputy Director of the China Eximbank and the Pakistani Ambassador to China signed a RMB 800 million loan agreement for the Paksat-1R Project (Project ID#43298). China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan also signed an RMB 86.5 million loan agreement for the construction of a ground control facility on October 29, 2010 (see Project ID #36953). Paksat-1R, a DFH-4-type satellite, was constructed by the Pakistan Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (SUPARCO) and the China Great Wall Industry Corporation (CGWIC). 
 
 On August 12, 2011, at the Chinese Xichang Satellite Launch Center, Pakistan’s first Communications Satellite PAKSAT-1R, as part of Pakistan’s Space Programme 2040, was launched. The launch was witnessed by Pakistani Secretary Defence Lt Gen Syed Athar Ali (R), Secretary Foreign Affairs, Salman Bashir, Director General, Strategic Plans Division Lt Gen Khalid Ahmed Kidwai (R) and Ambassador of Pakistan to China, Muhammad Masood Khan. Launched on the Long March 3B rocket, the Paksat-1R satellite has a design life of 15 years with initial goals to provide broadband internet access, digital television broadcasting, remote and rural telephony, emergency communications, tele-education and tele-medicine services across South and Central Asia, Eastern Europe, East Africa and the Far East. The satellite successfully took over the operations of its predecessor, the PakSat-1E satellite leased by Pakistan, in geostationary orbit at 38° East. The commercial services of the satellite were inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan on November 5, 2011 from the satellite ground station located near Lahore. On November 11, 2011, the ground control center was transferred to the Pakistani side for its use.","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=SCMCOM0020101115e6bf0000l&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.atimes.com/atimes/China/KJ07Ad01.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://spacenews.com/pakistan-china-space-deal-paksat-1r-ground-control-stations/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://tribune.com.pk/story/229797/paksat-1r-china-launches-pakistans-first-communications-satellite/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dawn.com/news/651018/pakistans-first-communications-satellite-paksat-1r-launched, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.pakistaneconomist.com/pagesearch/Search-Engine2009/S.E652.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.orfonline.org/research/chinas-design-to-capture-regional-satcom-markets/#_edn68, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=AIWNAT0020110429e74t0000u&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.eastasiaforum.org/2011/09/09/china-pakistan-space-technology-cooperation/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.gov.cn/jrzg/2009-09/18/content_1420933.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://cn.cgwic.com/paksat-1r/focus.html#, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.ofdi.net/hydt/1642.jhtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20170916210549/http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/tm/Newlist/index_343_30111.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.china.org.cn/2009-09/18/content_18554894.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2009-09/18/content_8710746.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://cn.cgwic.com/PakSat-1R/english/focus.html#, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://fp.brecorder.com/2009/08/20090826953037/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://suparco.gov.pk/downloadables/nsc23.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paksat-1R, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.suparco.gov.pk/pages/comm-satellite.asp?commlinksid=1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20101102203341/http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/Politics/30-Oct-2010/China-provides-loan-for-satellite-ground-control-segment, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","This project is coded up to country level since the whole country is under the satellite and not just one area of Pakistan.
