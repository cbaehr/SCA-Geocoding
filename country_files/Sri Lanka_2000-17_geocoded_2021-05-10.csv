33452,"China Eximbank provides $891 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase II of the Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project (Linked to Project ID #33244 and #33463)","On December 25, 2009, China Eximbank signed a $891 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase II of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, an interest rate of 2%, a 0.5% commitment fee, and a 0.5% management fee. 
The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the PBC to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the establishment of two power plants with a capacity of 300MW, a transmission line from Norochcholai to Anuradhapura, new substations at Chilaw and Anuradhapura and the construction of the expansion of coal handling port facilities and employees' housing. 
China Machinery Engineering Corporation was the contractor responsible for project implementation and its work was overseen by the CEB. Phase I of this project ran from 2007 to 2011 (see Project ID#33244 and #33463). The groundbreaking ceremony for Phase II of this project took place on March 18, 2010. The project was completed on September 16, 2014. 
The coal power plant is located in Norocholai, Puttalam on the southern end of the Kalpitiya Peninsula. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/44405. The transmission lines run from Norochcholai to Veyangoda and a substation at Veyangoda.""

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway.

 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake.

On this same day, China Development Bank signed an 805 million USD commercial loan financing agreement with CCC for this project (see attached 2014 article CDB). The 805 million USD loan from China Development Bank for the Colombo Port City Project is captured in this project. For details regarding the equity investment from CCC, see linked project ID #55528. 
The Colombo Port City (CPC) Project was initially conceived as a public sector project that would be undertaken by the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an “initial technical feasibility study” in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. 
In October 2010, Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. In April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications & Construction Company (CCCC), the parent company of CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) decided to not to commit public funds to construct the CPC Project and proceeded to negotiate with CCCC to implement the project entirely as a foreign direct investment, with no financial guarantees by the GOSL on the investment. 
After a 2.5 year period of negotiation with a Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) and a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) represented by 16 GOSL organizations, a project agreement was entered into between CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., and the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping (acting for and on behalf of the GOSL) on September 16, 2014. CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd., is a project company (special purpose vehicle) and wholly owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which operates under its parent company China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC). 
The project agreement was signed, and the project’s construction works were ceremonially inaugurated on the same day (September 16, 2014) in the presence of the President of the Peoples’ Republic of China and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, during the Chinese President’s State visit to Sri Lanka. Colombo Port City (CPC) Project is being implemented on public-private partnership (PPP) project and BOOT basis and it is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. 
The $1.396 billion project is divided into two phases: the first phase investment will cost $1.150 billion and the second phase investment will cost $246 million. The first phase was started on September 16, 2014. Its originally planned completion date was April 2020, but construction was suspended due to the change of government in March 2015. Construction then resumed in August 2016. The new expected completion date is April 2024. 
On May 12, 2017, China Development Bank provided a $805 million loan to CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. for the first phase of the project, or roughly 70% of the total cost of the first phase project of the project. The loan carries a 10-year maturity and a 3-year grace period. No sovereign guarantee was provided for the loan. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. 
STAFF_NOTE: This project is also known as the Colombo International Financial City (CIFC) project. The Chinese project title is 斯里兰卡科伦坡港口城项目. The second phase of the project is also expected to be financed with a debt-to-equity ratio of 70:30. This project is located on reclaimed land adjacent to the Galle Face Green in the city of Colombo. It is between the southern edge of the new Colombo South Port and the Fort Lighthouse. Its locational coordinates are 06°56′00″N 79°50′00″E.","Other Multisector","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=DAINSL0020131113e9be0009k&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

The construction of this building was dedicated to the memory of ex-PM Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who died in 2000. 
 On May 18, 2001, Chinese Prime Minister Zhu Rongji inaugurated the construction of the exhibition hall. It was officially opened on May 17, 2003, and at the time of its completion, it was reported to be South Asia's largest exhibition and convention hall. It consists of two indoor halls that can house 170 stalls and outdoor exhibition area of 5,000 square feet that is fully cemented. 
 This project is related to Project ID #38914, which captures the 2007 Chinese Government-financed repair and maintenance of BMICH. The Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition and Convention Centre is adjoining with the Bandaranayake Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH or 纪念班达拉奈克国际会议大厦), which was also constructed with Chinese grant funding in the 1970s. Other Projects related to Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition and Convention Centre and the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies are project ID#71573, which captured the RMB 1.7 million China grant to Sri Lanka for the provision of equipment to the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies, and project ID#71574, which captured the RMB 5 million China grant for the provision of technical and support services to Sirimavo Bandaranaike Memorial Exhibition and Convention Centre and the Bandaranaike Centre for International Studies.

Then, on July 8, 2004, the Chinese Government and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $10,857,433 interest-free loan agreement for the National Performing Arts Theater Project (captured in this project).
 The objective of this project was to construct a well-equipped modern theater in Colombo. The Nelum Pokuna Mahinda Rajapaksa Theatre (Sinhala: නෙළුම් පොකුණ මහින්ද රාජපක්ෂ රඟහල) — now known as Nelum Pokuna and previously known as the National Performing Arts Theatre — is a performing arts centre in Colombo, Sri Lanka. 
 Yanjian Group was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its construction began on May 23, 2008. The theatre opened on December 15, 2011. The building spreads over 14,000 square meters of floor area. The theatre is equipped with ultra-modern facilities such as an auditorium with 1,288 seats, a library, and training facilities. The building features two permanent theaters—the main auditorium and an open-air theatre—and the ability to convert the front steps into an additional open-air theatre. The 690-square-meter moving stage in the auditorium includes the ability to raise and lower the orchestra pit to and from stage level. There are facilities to conduct educational and research activities. Parking for 500 vehicles is also available.

China Eximbank covered 90% of the cost of the $79,528,000 EPC contract value (captured in Project ID#33184). The remaining 10% was funded by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). This project involved an onshore component and an offshore component. The onshore component of the project involved 29 diesel and kerosene storage tanks and all the matching facilities. The offshore component of the project involved a one-point mooring system and a 5.6 km submarine oil transmission pipeline. China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation — a construction subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation specializing in the construction of refineries and chemical fertilizer plants connected to refineries, and mining plants — was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation began in July 2001 and the Muthurajawela tank farm became operational on May 27, 2004. With the construction of this tank farm, Sri Lanka’s storage capacity for finished petroleum products increased by 250,000 tonnes. Muthurajawela tank farm consists of 21 tanks of 10,000 m3 capacity and 8 tanks of 5,000 m3 capacity. These tanks store and distribute diesel and kerosene. Along with the tanks, CPC installed a new SPBM system, where 60,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) ships could use the buoy for discharging imported finished products direct from sea to tanks via a submarine pipeline. This terminal includes a loading facility to distribute products by road tankers. However, rail transportation of petroleum products stored in the Muthurajawela tank farm is constrained due to the absence of a railway line. At the time of project completion, a dual pipeline transport systems named the ‘cross country pipeline’ with a length of 6.5 km was expected to link Muthurajawela tank farm with the Supugaskanda facility.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://web.archive.org/web/20101105185350/http://www.erd.gov.lk/publicweb/FAR%202000/FARreport2000.doc, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:yEyO30XCKogJ:fta.mofcom.gov.cn/inforimages/201407/20140731095621169.doc+&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Lanka-China-sign-deal-to-build-oil-tank-farm/articleshow/9946800.cms, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.people.cn/english/200012/05/eng20001205_56902.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","https://www.ceylonexpeditions.com/muthurajawela-wetland-sanctuary-boat-ride-sri-lanka#:~:text=Muthurajawela%20is%20a%20coastal%20wetland,of%20western%20province%20Sri%20Lanka.

This PBC carries the following terms: 2% interest rate. 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. 
The objective of the purpose of the project is to construct an expressway in the outskirts of Colombo which connects with the Southern Expressway and other national roads radiating from Colombo city in order to mitigate traffic congestion in the Colombo Metropolitan Region and enhance connectivity with other regions of the country, thereby contributing to the strengthening of economic development among the regions in Sri Lanka. The Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. 
The OCH Project consists of three main sections: Phase I runs from Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I); Phase II runs from Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km); and Phase III runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km). Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on August 20, 2014. Its originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. However, this project faced delays due to poor contractor performance, several houses refusing to vacate, and land acquisition problems at Kadawatha IC due to trade union activities in the survey department.. This project was ultimately completed on November 7, 2019.
Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project involves the construction of a 9.32 km segment of the Outer Circular Highway that runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya. A detailed map of the route of Phase III of the OCH Project is available within Annexure - 05 of the following document: https://mohsl.gov.lk/downloads/1565995085.pdf.

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71667 captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes. 
 STAFF_NOTE: The CKE is also known as the E03 expressway. Some sources identify the maturities of the China Eximbank BCLs as 16 years and the grace periods as 14 years.

53567,"China Development Bank provides $102.5 million loan for Thambuttegama Water Supply Project","On August 21, 2017, China Development Bank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $102.5 million loan agreement for the Thambuttegama Water Supply Project (WSP). The goal of this project is to provide safe drinking water via pipes to all 45 Grama Niladdhari divisions in Katana Divisional Secretariat covering 50% of the population in the area (similar to Project ID #53566). To do so, the project will, over 3 years, construct a water intake structure with a capacity of 42,000 m3/day, a water treatment plant of 18,000m3/day, a ground reservoir of 1,500 m3 capacity, a raw water and treated water transmission mains totaling up to an approximate length of 50 Km, elevated towers of 1,500 m3 capacity, a distribution network of 135 KM, and facilities to operate and maintain the water supply scheme. The project is expected to commence operations in 2021 and is in the tender evaluation stage as of March 2018. The project is being implemented by the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board. According to a March 2018 Sri Lanka news source, the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board Assistant General Manager for the North Central Province Sudath Ratnayake indicated that the CDB loan for this project carries an interest rate of 1-1.5 per cent plus London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and a maturity of 15 years. The interest rate is coded based on the 6-Month LIBOR rate at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6 month LIBOR (USD) for August 2017 was 1.454%. The least concessional base interest rate from the 1-1.5 per cent range was used to calculate the total interest rate. The total interest rate is therefore coded as 1.5% + 1.454%, or 2.954%. The total project is expected to cost $120.5 million; the remaining $18 million will be provided by the Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned, commercial bank in Sri Lanka. This project entered implementation on August 21, 2017. As of September 30, 2018, it had achieved a 'physical progress' rate of 4%.

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71670 captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes. 
 STAFF_NOTE: The CKE is also known as the E03 expressway. Some sources identify the maturities of the China Eximbank BCLs as 16 years and the grace periods as 14 years.

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71667 captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes.

Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71667 captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71670 captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes. 
STAFF_NOTE: The CKE is also known as the E03 expressway. Some sources identify the maturities of the China Eximbank BCLs as 16 years and the grace periods as 14 years. The objective of the Colombo-Katunayake Expressway (CKE) Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake.","Transport and Storage","https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/statistics/mbt/Monthly_Bulletin_August_2009.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/10181/12882/2013/99ec4ce9-183d-40ea-abfa-8331cdeee19d?version=1.0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2013/project_2013/ColomboKattunayakaExprees-wayE.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2014/Project/ColomboKatunayakaExpressWayProject2013E.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/tguhlze1ys9l8ex/Colombo%20Katunayake%20Expressway%20%28A1%20%2C%20A2%20%2C%20A3%20%26%20A4%29.pdf?dl=0 , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mcc.com.cn/mccen/csr/hse/347748/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2015/Projects_2015/4-XII-project/Colombo--Katunayake-Expressway-Project-E.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mcc.com.cn/mccen/focus/_325415/342031/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E03_expressway_(Sri_Lanka) , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mcc.com.cn/mcc/_132154/_132572/231644/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/colombo-katunayake-expressway-construction/d75b954f-1689-4ca5-9c0b-543258ca8505/ , Other; https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/439836093#map=14/7.0275/79.8914, Other; https://www.openstreetmap.org/way/336107413#map=11/6.9557/79.8832 , Other; https://www.google.com/maps/place/Colombo+-+Katunayake+Expy,+Sri+Lanka/@7.0587412,79.8444847,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ae2f1cb99359c6d:0xbb5ae225f130579!8m2!3d7.0587412!4d79.8795036 , Other; http://www.rda.gov.lk/supported/maps/expressway_network_as_at_2019_11_07.jpg, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","","http://www.rda.gov.lk/supported/maps/expressway_network_as_at_2019_11_07.jpg","Colombo is coded in this row.

The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake.","Transport and Storage","https://silo.tips/download/public-investment-supported-by-export-credit, Other; https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/statistics/mbt/Monthly_Bulletin_August_2009.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/10181/12882/2013/99ec4ce9-183d-40ea-abfa-8331cdeee19d?version=1.0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2013/project_2013/ColomboKattunayakaExprees-wayE.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2014/Project/ColomboKatunayakaExpressWayProject2013E.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2014/Project/ColomboKatunayakaExpressWayProject2013E.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mcc.com.cn/mccen/csr/hse/347748/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.auditorgeneral.gov.lk/web/images/audit-reports/upload/2015/Projects_2015/4-XII-project/Colombo--Katunayake-Expressway-Project-E.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mcc.com.cn/mccen/focus/_325415/342031/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E03_expressway_(Sri_Lanka) , Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.mcc.com.cn/mcc/_132154/_132572/231644/index.html , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","","https://www.google.com/search?q=colombo-katunayake+expressway&rlz=1C5CHFA_enUS754US754&oq=Colombo-Katunayake+Expressway&aqs=chrome.0.0l2j0i10i22i30j0i22i30j0i22i30i395l6.325j1j9&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8","Gampaha district and Colombo district are coded for this project since the expressway runs from Colombo, which is located in Colombo District, to katunayake, which is located in Gampaha district (Colombo)","all the actual districts the A3 runs thru","district",79.92,6.93,"Kolonnawa","Division","LKA.5.7_1","Sri Lanka"
70907,"China Eximbank provides RMB 46.8 million loan for Kelanitissa Diesel Tank Storage Farm Expansion Project","On May 16, 2004, China Eximbank and the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 46.8 million China Eximbank loan agreement for the Kelanitissa Diesel Tank Storage Farm Expansion Project. This loan carried a 2% interest rate. 
 The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from this China Eximbank loan to on-lend at a 10% interest rate to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the construction of two diesel storage tanks of 10,000 MT each at the Kelanithissa Power Station. This project started on September 23, 2004. It was completed on October 31, 2005. The implementing agency is China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (中国寰球工程公司).
 The Kelanitissa Power Station, which was commissioned in 2003, is located on the south bank of the Kelani River in the northern part of the city of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Its exact coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/40490 and https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kelanitissa+Power+Station/@6.9526629,79.8785059,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x478dd69521e70eb1?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid0v3n2c_pAhUFoHIEHePIAmgQ_BIwDXoECBcQCw.
 STAFF_NOTE: This project is sometimes referred to as the Kelanitissa Diesel Storage Tank Project. Some sources refer to the face value of the loan as $5,608,646. However, this is likely a USD conversion of an RMB-denominated government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank.","Energy Generation and Supply","https://www.ceb.lk/front_img/img_reports/1532060257CEB_Annual_Report_2011_(English).pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.ceb.lk/front_img/img_reports/1532060257CEB_Annual_Report_2011_(English).pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/50373-002-dc.pdf, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/63299/169171/financialStatementChapter15-2014.pdf/9d45a7b5-d3d6-4e62-bf2b-b4cdd1ed4e08, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.parliament.lk/papers_presented/24102012/annual_report_ceylon_electricity_board_2010.pdf , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelanitissa_Power_Station, Other; https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/linked-documents/47037-003-dc.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.parliament.lk/uploads/documents/hansard/PUBDOC2188_document.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.ceb.lk/front_img/img_reports/1532060257CEB_Annual_Report_2011_(English).pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.ceb.lk/front_img/img_reports/1532058566CEB_Annual_Report_2012_(English).pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.ofdi.net/hydt/2672.jhtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelanitissa_Power_Station","Kelanitissa Power Station is where the tank farm is located.

This PBC carries the following terms: 2% interest rate. 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. 
The objective of the purpose of the project is to construct an expressway in the outskirts of Colombo which connects with the Southern Expressway and other national roads radiating from Colombo city in order to mitigate traffic congestion in the Colombo Metropolitan Region and enhance connectivity with other regions of the country, thereby contributing to the strengthening of economic development among the regions in Sri Lanka. The Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. 
The OCH Project consists of three main sections: Phase I runs from Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I); Phase II runs from Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km); and Phase III runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km). Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on August 20, 2014. Its originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. However, this project faced delays due to poor contractor performance, several houses refusing to vacate, and land acquisition problems at Kadawatha IC due to trade union activities in the survey department.. This project was ultimately completed on November 7, 2019.
Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project involves the construction of a 9.32 km segment of the Outer Circular Highway that runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya. A detailed map of the route of Phase III of the OCH Project is available within Annexure - 05 of the following document: https://mohsl.gov.lk/downloads/1565995085.pdf.

53565,"China Development Bank provides $195 million loan for Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project","In February 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $195,075,000 million loan agreement for the Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project (Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme). This loan carries the following terms: 15 year maturity, 3 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.95 margin interest rate, and commitment fee of 0.5%. Given that the 6M LIBOR rate in February 2016 was 0.371 %, the total interest rate amounted to 3.321%. The total cost of the project is $229.49 million. China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to cover 85% of the cost. while the remaining 15 percent was borrowed from Bank of Ceylon. 
 The goal of the project is to provide safe and reliable drinking water to the areas of the Gampaha, Minuwangoda and Attanagalla Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and part of Meerigama Divisional Secretariat (DS) division. The project is expected to take three years, and will include the construction of Basnagoda 3.5 MCM capacity impounding reservoir at Karasnagala, the construction of 85,000 m3/day capacity water intake at Karasnagala, the construction of 54,000 m3/day capacity Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Karasnagala, the construction of a waste water and sludge treatment facility including all accessories and pumping equipment at the treatment plant premises, the construction of 10,000 m3 capacity High Level Reservoir (HLR) at Nikahetikanda, construction of five 1,500 m3 capacity elevated water towers at Ranpokunugama, Belummahara, Naiwala, Minuwangoda and Pasyala, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm diameter Ductile Iron (DI) pipes for raw water pumping main of 1.75 km length approximately from the water intake to the WTP, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm dia. DI pipes for treated water pumping main of 1.65 km length approximately from the WTP to the high level reservoir (HLR), the supply and laying of 1,100 mm dia. to 150mm dia. range DI pipes for the gravity transmission main approximate length of 89.2 km from the HLR to existing and new water towers, supply and laying of 225 mm dia. to 90 mm dia. range uPVC pipes for the distribution network, approximate length of 600 km, supply and laying of 400 mm dia. to 300 mm dia. range DI pipes for balance part of the distribution network, approximate length of 30 km, and finally catchment protection. 
The contractor responsible for project implementation is China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). As of January 31 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a “physical progress” rate of 20.27%. 
This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. The decision to grant a $229.5 million contract to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) in 2012 was based on an unsolicited proposal from the firm. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended continuation of the CMEC project. 
The Auditor General’s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company’s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects, and that in the experience section of CMEC’s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tiagin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). 
The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018 to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.","Water Supply and Sanitation","http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2018-10-23&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Performance%20of%20Priority%20Projects.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/pdf/performance_report_2016_english_version.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MENREP0020130517e95h001lh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.colombopage.com/archive_14B/Dec07_1417973694CH.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Progress%20of%20Prority%20Project%20as%20at%2031%20January%202018.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ft.lk/article/151679/Chinese-firm-signs----229-5-m-contract-for-water--project-in-Sri-Lanka, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/08/12/news/cmec-attanagalla-water-project-ag-points-%E2%80%98colossal%E2%80%99-squander-public-funds, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://srilankamirror.com/news/7821-cbk-demands-suspension-of-multimillion-dollar-chinese-water-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwftwdri1p93q9h/Gampaha%20Attanagalla%20and%20Miniwangoda%20Intergrated%20Water%20Supply%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://english.newstube.lk/news/1785-ag-red-flags-basil-s-attanagalla-water-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201907/30/WS5d3f856ba310d83056401a49.html , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/statistics/mbt/bulletin_september_16e-min.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://en.cmec.com/xwzx/gsxw/201911/t20191108_225919.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.waterboard.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=58&Itemid=272&lang=en, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.waterboard.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=58&Itemid=272&lang=en, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MENREP0020130517e95h001lh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/08/12/news/cmec-attanagalla-water-project-ag-points-%E2%80%98colossal%E2%80%99-squander-public-funds, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attanagalla_Divisional_Secretariat, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuwangoda","The three Divisional Secretariats are all located in Gampaha District, so I used QGIS to code the area that benefitted from the water supply increase.","actual districts","district",79.98,7.15,"Minuwangoda","Division","LKA.7.10_1","Sri Lanka"

This PBC carries the following terms: 2% interest rate. 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 0.25% commitment fee, and a 0.25% management fee. 
The objective of the purpose of the project is to construct an expressway in the outskirts of Colombo which connects with the Southern Expressway and other national roads radiating from Colombo city in order to mitigate traffic congestion in the Colombo Metropolitan Region and enhance connectivity with other regions of the country, thereby contributing to the strengthening of economic development among the regions in Sri Lanka. The Outer Circular Highway (OCH) is located at the Colombo Metropolitan Region and passes through two administrative districts, namely Colombo and Gampaha. 
The OCH Project consists of three main sections: Phase I runs from Kottawa to Kaduwela (11.0 km) (Phase I); Phase II runs from Kaduwela to Kadawatha (8.9 km); and Phase III runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya (9.32 km). Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on August 20, 2014. Its originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. However, this project faced delays due to poor contractor performance, several houses refusing to vacate, and land acquisition problems at Kadawatha IC due to trade union activities in the survey department.. This project was ultimately completed on November 7, 2019.
Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project involves the construction of a 9.32 km segment of the Outer Circular Highway that runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya. A detailed map of the route of Phase III of the OCH Project is available within Annexure - 05 of the following document: https://mohsl.gov.lk/downloads/1565995085.pdf.

53565,"China Development Bank provides $195 million loan for Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project","In February 2016, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $195,075,000 million loan agreement for the Gampaha, Attanagalla, and Miniwangoda Integrated Water Supply Project (Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme). This loan carries the following terms: 15 year maturity, 3 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.95 margin interest rate, and commitment fee of 0.5%. Given that the 6M LIBOR rate in February 2016 was 0.371 %, the total interest rate amounted to 3.321%. The total cost of the project is $229.49 million. China Development Bank (CDB) agreed to cover 85% of the cost. while the remaining 15 percent was borrowed from Bank of Ceylon. 
 The goal of the project is to provide safe and reliable drinking water to the areas of the Gampaha, Minuwangoda and Attanagalla Divisional Secretariat (DS) divisions and part of Meerigama Divisional Secretariat (DS) division. The project is expected to take three years, and will include the construction of Basnagoda 3.5 MCM capacity impounding reservoir at Karasnagala, the construction of 85,000 m3/day capacity water intake at Karasnagala, the construction of 54,000 m3/day capacity Water Treatment Plant (WTP) at Karasnagala, the construction of a waste water and sludge treatment facility including all accessories and pumping equipment at the treatment plant premises, the construction of 10,000 m3 capacity High Level Reservoir (HLR) at Nikahetikanda, construction of five 1,500 m3 capacity elevated water towers at Ranpokunugama, Belummahara, Naiwala, Minuwangoda and Pasyala, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm diameter Ductile Iron (DI) pipes for raw water pumping main of 1.75 km length approximately from the water intake to the WTP, the supply and laying of 1,000 mm dia. DI pipes for treated water pumping main of 1.65 km length approximately from the WTP to the high level reservoir (HLR), the supply and laying of 1,100 mm dia. to 150mm dia. range DI pipes for the gravity transmission main approximate length of 89.2 km from the HLR to existing and new water towers, supply and laying of 225 mm dia. to 90 mm dia. range uPVC pipes for the distribution network, approximate length of 600 km, supply and laying of 400 mm dia. to 300 mm dia. range DI pipes for balance part of the distribution network, approximate length of 30 km, and finally catchment protection. 
The contractor responsible for project implementation is China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). As of January 31 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a “physical progress” rate of 20.27%. 
This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. The decision to grant a $229.5 million contract to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) in 2012 was based on an unsolicited proposal from the firm. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended continuation of the CMEC project. 
The Auditor General’s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company’s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects, and that in the experience section of CMEC’s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tiagin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). 
The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018 to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.","Water Supply and Sanitation","http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2018-10-23&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Performance%20of%20Priority%20Projects.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/pdf/performance_report_2016_english_version.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MENREP0020130517e95h001lh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.colombopage.com/archive_14B/Dec07_1417973694CH.php, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Progress%20of%20Prority%20Project%20as%20at%2031%20January%202018.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.ft.lk/article/151679/Chinese-firm-signs----229-5-m-contract-for-water--project-in-Sri-Lanka, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/08/12/news/cmec-attanagalla-water-project-ag-points-%E2%80%98colossal%E2%80%99-squander-public-funds, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://srilankamirror.com/news/7821-cbk-demands-suspension-of-multimillion-dollar-chinese-water-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/gwftwdri1p93q9h/Gampaha%20Attanagalla%20and%20Miniwangoda%20Intergrated%20Water%20Supply%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://english.newstube.lk/news/1785-ag-red-flags-basil-s-attanagalla-water-project, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201907/30/WS5d3f856ba310d83056401a49.html , Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/statistics/mbt/bulletin_september_16e-min.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://en.cmec.com/xwzx/gsxw/201911/t20191108_225919.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.waterboard.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=58&Itemid=272&lang=en, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://www.waterboard.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=58&Itemid=272&lang=en, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=MENREP0020130517e95h001lh&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/08/12/news/cmec-attanagalla-water-project-ag-points-%E2%80%98colossal%E2%80%99-squander-public-funds, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attanagalla_Divisional_Secretariat, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuwangoda","The three Divisional Secretariats are all located in Gampaha District, so I used QGIS to code the area that benefitted from the water supply increase.","actual districts","district",80.11,7.11,"Attanagalla","Division","LKA.7.1_1","Sri Lanka"

33463,"China Eximbank provides $155 million buyer’s credit loan for Phase I of the Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project (Linked to Project ID#33244 and #33452)","On August 30, 2005, China Eximbank signed a $300 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) with with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase I of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project. Then, on September 8, 2006, China Eximbank signed a $155 million buyer’s credit loan (BCL) with the Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka for the Phase I of Puttalam/Norochcholai Coal Power Project (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2009 Annual Performance Report). The PBC carries a 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, and an interest rate of 2%. The BCL carries a 15 year maturity, a 5 year grace period, and a 6% interest rate. The PBC is captured in Project ID#33244. 
 
 The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from the BCL and PBC to on-lend to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the installation of a 300MW coal power plant, a jetty for coal handling, and transmission lines from Norochcholai to Veyangoda and substation at Veyangoda. 
 
 China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. A project inauguration ceremony took place on May 11, 2006. Phase I construction began on July 23, 2007. The first 300-megawatt phase was completed and ceremonially commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on March 22, 2011.

45520,"China Eximbank provides $138.21 million in debt financing for Section IV (Pinnaduwa-Godagama) of the Southern Transport Development Project (STDP)","On February 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed two different buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreements (No.BLA201011 and No.BLA201012) for Section IV (Pinnaduwa-Godagama) of the Southern Transport Development Project (STDP). No.BLA201011 supported “Package 1” [Highway Section from Pinnaduwa to Kodagoda (30.8 km to 45 km)], while No.BLA201012 supported Package 2 [Highway Section from Kodagoda to Godagama (45 km to 61.05 km) and balance work in Galle Port Access Road]. The face values of these two BCLs are unknown. However, the combined value of these two BCL is $138.21 million. We therefore record these two BCLs in a single project record (Project ID#45520). 
Both of these loans carried the same terms: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + a 2.40% margin, maturity of 15 years, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, 0.3% management fee, and 6% exposure fee. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in February 2011 was 0.464%, so the total interest rate is coded as 0.464% + 2.40%, or 2.864%. 
The Southern Transport Development Project (STDP) is the largest greenfield road project ever implemented in Sri Lanka. The purpose of the STDP was to assist the development of the economy of Sri Lanka’s Southern Province by encouraging growth in industries, tourism, fisheries and agriculture by connecting the access roads to the country’s first access controlled highway. The STDP was financed by the Government of Sri Lanka and five development partners (Asian Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Corporation, Nordic Development Fund, Swedish International Development Association, and China Eximbank). 
The project involved the construction of the Southern Expressway, which is an access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers (km) from Kottawa to Godagama; the Galle Port Access Road, which is a 5.5 km long access road from the Southern Expressway to Galle; and a road safety component. The Southern Expressway was divided into four sections for financing purposes. Section I is from Kottawa to Dodangoda. Section II is from Dodangoda to Kurundugahahethekma. Section III is from Kurundugahahethekma to Pinnaduwa. Section IV is a 30.8 km segment of the expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in Section IV. 
 China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of Package 1 and Package 2. It signed an EPC contract on June 11, 2010. It commenced work in April 2011. It completed its work in January 2014 and the Pinnaduwa-Godagama section of the Southern Expressway was opened to traffic on March 16, 2014. Upon completion of the Southern Expressway (STDP) Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a project completion report. It rated the project as “effective” in achieving the expected outcomes, which included an expressway in operational condition and increased economic opportunities for residents in the southern region of the country. 
 The travel time between Colombo and Matara was reduced to 1.5 hours as of March 2014. Also, after the opening of the Southern Expressway, there was a reduction in the fatal accident rate on the Galle Road. In 2010, the accident rate was 25 per 1 million vehicles; in 2011, it went down to 21 per 1 million vehicles, and in 2012 it was 16 per 1 million vehicles. Two new industrial estates (Koggala and Mirijjawila) were set up in the Southern Province and Hambanthota Port and Hambanthota International Airport were built after the STDP project started. While the expressway section from Kottawa to Galle has only been operating since November 2011, the social and economic investments made under the STDP since 2000 have attracted borrower and private sector investment to the Southern Province.
Overall, there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all three districts in the Southern Province. The four sample villages (Godagama, Kabaragala, Paraduwa, Yaddehimulla) in the ADB’s design and monitoring framework are in Galle and Matara districts. Yakdehimulla and Kabaragala are close to the Galle Port Access Road and the Pinnaduwa Interchange. The other two villages mainly benefited from the section of the Southern Expressway funded by China Eximbank. The ADB’s project completion report notes that there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all four villages. 
 This project supported a 30.8 km section of the Southern Expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in this section. This China Eximbank-financed project also supported balance work in Galle Port Access Road. The Southern Expressway is a access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers from Kottawa to Godagama.

45520,"China Eximbank provides $138.21 million in debt financing for Section IV (Pinnaduwa-Godagama) of the Southern Transport Development Project (STDP)","On February 17, 2011, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed two different buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreements (No.BLA201011 and No.BLA201012) for Section IV (Pinnaduwa-Godagama) of the Southern Transport Development Project (STDP). No.BLA201011 supported “Package 1” [Highway Section from Pinnaduwa to Kodagoda (30.8 km to 45 km)], while No.BLA201012 supported Package 2 [Highway Section from Kodagoda to Godagama (45 km to 61.05 km) and balance work in Galle Port Access Road]. The face values of these two BCLs are unknown. However, the combined value of these two BCL is $138.21 million. We therefore record these two BCLs in a single project record (Project ID#45520). 
Both of these loans carried the same terms: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + a 2.40% margin, maturity of 15 years, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, 0.3% management fee, and 6% exposure fee. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in February 2011 was 0.464%, so the total interest rate is coded as 0.464% + 2.40%, or 2.864%. 
The Southern Transport Development Project (STDP) is the largest greenfield road project ever implemented in Sri Lanka. The purpose of the STDP was to assist the development of the economy of Sri Lanka’s Southern Province by encouraging growth in industries, tourism, fisheries and agriculture by connecting the access roads to the country’s first access controlled highway. The STDP was financed by the Government of Sri Lanka and five development partners (Asian Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Corporation, Nordic Development Fund, Swedish International Development Association, and China Eximbank). 
The project involved the construction of the Southern Expressway, which is an access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers (km) from Kottawa to Godagama; the Galle Port Access Road, which is a 5.5 km long access road from the Southern Expressway to Galle; and a road safety component. The Southern Expressway was divided into four sections for financing purposes. Section I is from Kottawa to Dodangoda. Section II is from Dodangoda to Kurundugahahethekma. Section III is from Kurundugahahethekma to Pinnaduwa. Section IV is a 30.8 km segment of the expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in Section IV. 
 China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of Package 1 and Package 2. It signed an EPC contract on June 11, 2010. It commenced work in April 2011. It completed its work in January 2014 and the Pinnaduwa-Godagama section of the Southern Expressway was opened to traffic on March 16, 2014. Upon completion of the Southern Expressway (STDP) Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a project completion report. It rated the project as “effective” in achieving the expected outcomes, which included an expressway in operational condition and increased economic opportunities for residents in the southern region of the country. 
 The travel time between Colombo and Matara was reduced to 1.5 hours as of March 2014. Also, after the opening of the Southern Expressway, there was a reduction in the fatal accident rate on the Galle Road. In 2010, the accident rate was 25 per 1 million vehicles; in 2011, it went down to 21 per 1 million vehicles, and in 2012 it was 16 per 1 million vehicles. Two new industrial estates (Koggala and Mirijjawila) were set up in the Southern Province and Hambanthota Port and Hambanthota International Airport were built after the STDP project started. While the expressway section from Kottawa to Galle has only been operating since November 2011, the social and economic investments made under the STDP since 2000 have attracted borrower and private sector investment to the Southern Province.
Overall, there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all three districts in the Southern Province. The four sample villages (Godagama, Kabaragala, Paraduwa, Yaddehimulla) in the ADB’s design and monitoring framework are in Galle and Matara districts. Yakdehimulla and Kabaragala are close to the Galle Port Access Road and the Pinnaduwa Interchange. The other two villages mainly benefited from the section of the Southern Expressway funded by China Eximbank. The ADB’s project completion report notes that there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all four villages. 
 This project supported a 30.8 km section of the Southern Expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in this section. This China Eximbank-financed project also supported balance work in Galle Port Access Road. The Southern Expressway is a access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers from Kottawa to Godagama.

This loan carries a grace period of 3 years, a maturity of 15 years, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 6.3% margin. The interest rate comes out to be 6.709%, since the LIBOR 6-month rate was 0.409% and the margin was 6.3%. Sinosure provided insurance for the loan. 
 The total cost of the 35 MW Broadlands Hydropower Project was $82 million. ICBC covered 85% of the cost, and Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka covered the remaining 15%. The project involved the construction of 35 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric complex over the Kelani River in Kitulgala. More specifically, it involved the construction of a 24m high & 144m long main dam, a 19m high & 48m long diversion dam, a 2.7m diameter & 850m long diversion tunnel, a 5.4m diameter & 3 km long main tunnel, a 35MW surface power station (2 units of 17.5MW), a switch yard, and a 4 km long transmission line. The complex has an installed capacity of 35 MW and is expected to generate 126 GWh of electrical energy annually. 
 The contractor responsible for implementation was China National Electric Equipment Corporation. Its work was supervised by Ceylon Electricity Board, the largest electricity company in Sri Lanka. Construction began on July 17, 2013. River closure took place on November 20, 2016. On June 6, 2019, a breakthrough ceremony of the main headrace tunnel took place. Project implementation was still underway in late 2019. 
 The Broadlands dam is a 35 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric complex over the Kelani River in the town on Kitulgala. Its exact locational coordinates are 06°58′44″N 80°27′16″E. See https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Broadlands_Dam&params=06_58_44_N_80_27_16_E_type:landmark.

53528,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.636 billion government concessional loan for Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project","On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 1,636,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project. This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

53528,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.636 billion government concessional loan for Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project","On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 1,636,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project. This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

53657,"Chinese Government provides $105 million grant for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology Project","On February 16, 2016, the Chinese Government and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $105 million grant agreement for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology Project. This project involves the construction of a scientific research complex, a water quality analysis platform, a pilot study center, expert accommodations, and supporting facilities. 
The purpose of the project, which is taking place in Kandy (Sri Lanka’s second largest city) is to find a scientific solution to end chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKD). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has spread over 11 districts in Sri Lanka mainly due to the changes in various human activities and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, it has become a major health issue. This disease is particularly acute among the farmers’ 40-60 age groups. Most researchers believe that the cause of CKD is drinking contaminated water. China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (CTCE) — a subsidiary of China Railway Group Ltd. — is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 28, 2018. Then, on July 17, 2009, the project successfully passed mid-term acceptance with the funder of the project (the Chinese Government’s Ministry of Commerce). The originally anticipated project completion date was May 2020.

53528,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.636 billion government concessional loan for Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project","On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 1,636,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project. This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

53528,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.636 billion government concessional loan for Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project","On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 1,636,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project. This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.
The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

39029,"China Development Bank provides $214.2 million loan for Moragahakanda Development Project","On June 28, 2012, China Development Bank Corporation (CDB) signed a $214.2 million loan agreement [ID# 4510201201100000017] with the Government of Sri Lanka for the Moragahakanda Development Project. The loan carried the following terms: a variable interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.90% margin, a grace period of 4 years, a 16 year maturity, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5.9% risk (insurance) premium. 
The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.
The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.
This project is sometimes also referred to as the Moragahakanda Kalu Ganga Multipurpose Development Project.","Other Multisector","http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/ERD%20Performance%20Report%202012%20-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://asiantribune.com/node/85666, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2012/11/18/fea06.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2018-10-23&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/udvlumdle28we4n/Government%20of%20Sri%20Lanka%202017%20Bond%20Prospectus.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://lk.chineseembassy.org/chn/xwdt/t1525761.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/powerchina/2016-07/26/content_26392353.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/dl/gbdqzn/upload/sililanka.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moragahakanda_Dam, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/10181/12882/2013/99ec4ce9-183d-40ea-abfa-8331cdeee19d?version=1.0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/pdf/august2_2017.PDF, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/publications/annual_report/2015/en/14_Part_02.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.cdb.com.cn/English/xwzx_715/khdt/201703/t20170314_4140.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ft.lk/news/Moragahakanda-Kalu-Ganga-development-project-is-a-strong-foundation-to-build-a-prosperous-country-i/56-646944, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9W7uKQcuryQ, Other; http://www.dailynews.lk/2018/01/06/local/139119/moragahakanda-development-project-national-ceremony-january-8, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://en.powerchina.cn//2018-11/05/content_37265731.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","https://libportal.jica.go.jp/library/Data/DocforEnvironment/RAP-RIP/EastAsia-SouthwesternAsian/Moragahakanda/MoragahakandaRIP.pdf","The Moragahakanda Dam is located in Matale District.

According to the Sri Lanka Department of External Resources Performance Report 2017, this loan covers 100% of the estimated project cost.
This project is expected to be completed in 3 years. The goal of the project is to provide safe drinking water to Bandarawela, Diyathalawa, Haputhale and Valachchenai. China National Aero–Technology International Engineering Corporation (CATIC) and China Geo Engineering Corporation (CHINA GEO ENG) are the contractors responsible for project implementation. Their work is being supervised by the Sri Lanka National Water Supply and Drainage Board. The project officially entered implementation on August 30, 2017. 
Staff Note: This project is one of the four water supply projects under implementation in Sri Lanka funded by the China Development Bank. The other three projects are: Project ID# 54435 (Gampaha, Attanagalla and Minuwangoda Integrated Water Supply Scheme), Project ID# 53566 (Katana Water supply Project), and Project ID# 53567 (Thambuttegama Water Supply Project). In Sri Lanka government documents, the Valachchenai Water Supply Project and Bandarawela, Diyathalawa and Haputhale Water Supply Project are sometimes referred to as 'Balance of 400 million facility for priority Water Supply Projects', because they account for the final allocation of a $400 million CDB loan facility for water supply projects.","Water Supply and Sanitation","http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2018-10-23&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=97:recently-signed-water-projects-china-division&catid=30&lang=en&Itemid=225, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.waterboard.lk/web/index.php?option=com_content&view=category&id=58&Itemid=272&lang=en, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfeccl6aq3hgq42/%20Valachchenai%20Water%20Supply%20Project%20Bandarawela%2C%20Diyathalawa%2C%20Haputhale%20Water%20Supply%20Project.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=12&today=2019-10-17&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","","https://www.dropbox.com/s/wfeccl6aq3hgq42/%20Valachchenai%20Water%20Supply%20Project%20Bandarawela%2C%20Diyathalawa%2C%20Haputhale%20Water%20Supply%20Project.pdf?dl=0","Bandarawela, Diyathalawa, and Haputhale are all located in Badulla District.

The PBC loan covers 85% of the total project cost, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a commitment fee of 0.2%, a management fee of 0.2%, a maturity of 15 years, and a 5 year grace period. 
The estimated total cost of the project is $174 million, and the remaining 15% of the project cost ($26.1 million) that is not covered by the China Eximbank loan will be provided by the Peoples Bank, a state-owned commercial bank in Sri Lanka. The contractor responsible for project implementation is Sinohydro Corporation Ltd. As of March 31, 2018, funds had not yet been disbursed, but a pre-feasibility study had been completed and the PBC loan agreement had been approved. 
The objective of the Thalpitigala Reservoir Project is to improve the agricultural productivity in the Badulla district by providing irrigation water while enhancing provision of safe drinking water and generation of hydropower. The scope of this project includes the provision of irrigation water to new and existing lands around 1400 hectares in the area through constructing upstream of the Battmedilla anicut in the Badulla district (within Uva Province), and the provision of safe drinking water facilities to Wasanagama, Madulla, Thetilla and Beramada villages in the Kandaketiya Divisonal Secretary's Division. 
 It also involves the construction of a hydropower station with a capacity of 15 MW that will generate 51 GWh of hydro power annually to fed the national grid. More specifically, this project will construct a concrete gravity dam in the mode of Roller Compacted Concrete (RCC) across Uma Oya, approximately 3 km upstream of the existing Bathmedilla Anicut (near the village Hunuketiya), to establish a 15.56 mcm capacity reservoir at full supply level of 454 m. The height of the proposed dam will be 45.7 m and it will result in the inundation of 96 ha of land confined mainly to the banks of the deep river valley. 
 The head works of the project include the dam, a spillway with seven radial gates (10m x 7.2m), water intake, headrace tunnel, surge shaft, penstock, power house and new access roads. In addition to the head works the project will also involve construction of structures such as camp sites, site offices, storage areas, vehicle parks etc which can use later for community purposes. The project commencement date was December 22, 2017.","Water Supply and Sanitation","http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2018-10-23&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/Publications/ERDReport2017/ERDReport2017-English.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Third_quarter_2017-new.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=114:news&catid=29&Itemid=226&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://irrigationmin.gov.lk/thalpitigala-reservoir-project/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://en.powerchina.cn/2018-11/13/content_37258459.htm, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.pmm.gov.lk/resources/Full%20Report.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=12&today=2019-10-17&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.e97peraengineers.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/report-Thalpitigala-Reservoir-Project-Corrected.pdf, Other; http://www.erd.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_rmobilization&view=resource_project&category_id=1&sub_category_id=1&searchby=donor_type&donor_id=4&today=2019-10-17&Itemid=321&lang=en, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20180107040947/http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","","http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/powerchina/2018-11/13/content_37258459.htm","The source discuss the location of the dam and its impact are in Badulla District.

39024,"China Eximbank provides RMB 700 million government concessional loan for Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project (Linked to Project ID #33481, #39023 and #39025)","On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank signed three loan agreements with Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project: a $51 million China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan (BCL), a $600 million China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit (PBC), and an RMB 1 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan (GCL). 
SLPA is the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month Libor + a 4% margin, 15-year maturity, 4-year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. The GCL (worth $158,358,086) carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 7-year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced by RMB 300 million (to RMB 700 million). The BCL is recorded in Project ID#39025. The PBC is recorded in Project ID#39023. The GCL [China Eximbank GCL no. 2012(22) Total No 424] is recorded in Project ID#39024 (this project). 
Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. 
Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbor Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. 
However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems. As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank. China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017. 
STAFF_NOTE: Multiple sources refer to a $808 million or $809 million China Eximbank loan for the Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project. These values are roughly equivalent to the combined value of the BCL, PBC, and GCL. Some sources also identify the maturities and grace periods of the GCL and PBC as 19 years (rather than 20 years) and 6 years (rather than 7 years), respectively. The Hambantota Port (also known as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port) is a maritime port in Hambantota, Sri Lanka.

The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, commitment fee of 0.5%, and management fee of 0.5%. The purpose of the $209 million project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport. 
China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building. Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony. 
This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meter terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed “the world’s emptiest international airport.” 
Sri Lanka’s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, “when I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she’d stamped that day. She said, ‘One’.” Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. The national carrier released a public statement that read: “[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan’s efforts to turn itself around. … SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.” 
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project is located in the town of Mattala, 18 km (11 mi) from Hambantota. Additional locational information can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mattala+Rajapaksa+Hambantota+Airport/@6.2929635,81.1239019,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4f504dac455a700c?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiymbiF1dbpAhXClXIEHS6dCcsQ_BIwE3oECBcQCA.
STAFF_NOTE: Some reports suggest that the face value of the China Eximbank GCL was $209 million. However, this figure refers to the total cost of the project (prior to cost overruns). In correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Director of the China and AIIB Division with the External Resources Department of Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs confirmed that USD loan value of the RMB-denominated China Eximbank loan is approximately $190 million. Note that the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also known as the Mattala Hambantota International Airport Project, Hambantota International Airport, and Southern International Airport).","Transport and Storage","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PMPLUN0020091226e5cq0006g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

33329,"China Eximbank provides $65 million buyer’s credit loan for Hambantota Bunkering Project","On August 6, 2009, China Eximbank and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) signed a $65,094,508 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (No. BLA0902) for the Hambantota Bunkering Project. The BCL carried the following terms: 15 year maturity, 3 year grace period, interest rate of 6.5%, 0.3% commitment fee, and 0.3% management fee. This project involved the construction of a bunkering facility at Hambantota Port. 
The bunkering facility and tank farm are located 1.2 km from the Hambantota waterfront, and are connected to the oil terminal through a pipeline. The facility has 14 tanks (total storage of 80,000 m3). Eight of these storage tanks carry bunker oil for ships and six of the storage tank tanks carry aviation fuel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This project was part of a broader effort by SLPA and the Government of Sri Lanka to position Hambantota port as a refueling and service point for cargo ships, which pass a few kilometers away off the southern tip of the country on one of the world’s busiest east-west shipping lanes. 
 The contract for the Hambantota Bunkering Project was awarded to the China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation. The project began in 2009 and its mechanical works were completed on October 10, 2011. Bunkering operations began after a project completion ceremony on June 22, 2014, and they are run by the SPLA. 
 However, these operations were late suspended due to a loss of $19.9 million as a result of irregularities. 17,818 metric tons of marine gas oil were purchased by the Government of Sri Lanka for oil bunkering at the tank farm yard, but SLPA was only able to sell 3,235 metric tons due to the poor quality of oil. 
 The bunkering facility is located 1.2 km from Hambantota Port (also known as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port), which is a maritime port in Hambantota, Sri Lanka. Detailed locational coordinates for Hambantota Port are available at https://tools.wmflabs.org/geohack/geohack.php?pagename=Magampura_Mahinda_Rajapaksa_Port&params=06_07_10_N_81_06_29_E_region:LK

39023,"China Eximbank provides $600 million preferential buyer’s credit for Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project (Linked to Project ID#33481, #39024 and #39025)","On September 17, 2012, China Eximbank signed three loan agreements with Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) for Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project: a $51 million China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan (BCL), a $600 million China Eximbank preferential buyer’s credit (PBC), and an RMB 1 billion China Eximbank government concessional loan (GCL). SLPA is the state-owned operator of major commercial ports in Sri Lanka. 
 
 The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month Libor + a 4% margin, 15 year maturity, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, and a 0.9% management fee. The PBC carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. The GCL (worth $158,358,086) carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20 year maturity, 7 year grace period, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. However, the face value of the GCL was eventually reduced by RMB 300 million (to RMB 700 million). The BCL is recorded in Project ID#39025. The PBC is recorded in Project ID#39023 (this project). The GCL [China Eximbank GCL no. 2012(22) Total No 424] is recorded in Project ID#39024. 
 
 Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. 
 
 The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbour Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems. As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. 
 
 Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank. China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017. 
 
 Staff Note: Multiple sources refer to a $808 million or $809 million China Eximbank loan for the Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project.

33369,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.3 billion government concessional loan for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project","On December 23, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 1.3 billion for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, commitment fee of 0.5%, and management fee of 0.5%. The purpose of the $209 million project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport. 
China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building. Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony. 
This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meter terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed “the world’s emptiest international airport.” 
Sri Lanka’s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, “when I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she’d stamped that day. She said, ‘One’.” Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. The national carrier released a public statement that read: “[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan’s efforts to turn itself around. … SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.” 
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project is located in the town of Mattala, 18 km (11 mi) from Hambantota. Additional locational information can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Mattala+Rajapaksa+Hambantota+Airport/@6.2929635,81.1239019,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x4f504dac455a700c?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiymbiF1dbpAhXClXIEHS6dCcsQ_BIwE3oECBcQCA.
STAFF_NOTE: Some reports suggest that the face value of the China Eximbank GCL was $209 million. However, this figure refers to the total cost of the project (prior to cost overruns). In correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Director of the China and AIIB Division with the External Resources Department of Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs confirmed that USD loan value of the RMB-denominated China Eximbank loan is approximately $190 million. Note that the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also known as the Mattala Hambantota International Airport Project, Hambantota International Airport, and Southern International Airport).","Transport and Storage","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PMPLUN0020091226e5cq0006g&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

72243,"CICT donated US$150,000 to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation","On May 21, 2012, the Colombo International Container Terminals Limited (CICT), which is a joint venture of the China Merchants Port Holdings Company (CMPort) and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) donated $150,000 (Rs.19,410,000) to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation for the construction of houses for the under-privileged as part of the company’s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The donated amount from the Chinese side is unknown, so the transaction amount has been removed.
 
 The donation had been remitted to Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation by CICT through the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (cheque No. 594691) to the Foundation’s account (No. 204-1-001-5-0003290) maintained at Peoples Bank. It was said that the donation was made long after the project concession agreement for the Colombo South Terminal had been signed and construction work on the terminal had already commenced. The payment is clearly reflected in its audited accounts for the relevant year. However, though the donation was documented as construction costs, some reports suggest that the donation was for Mahinda Rajapaksa’s 2015 re-election campaign.","Support to Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Government Organizations","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=SLDAIM0020180716ee7d0000i&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.lankaweb.com/news/items/2018/07/12/rs-19-mn-to-pushpa-rajapaksa-foundation-was-a-donation-cict/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Rs-mn-to-Pushpa-Rajapaksa-Foundation-was-a-donation-CICT-152607.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.dailymirror.lk/article/Questionable-Donation-from-CICT-States-that-the-monies-offered-to-the-Pushpa-Rajapaksa-Foundation-was-done-as-part-of-a-CSR-commitment-152833.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.business-standard.com/article/pti-stories/chinese-company-says-donated-to-rajapaksa-family-foundation-118071201235_1.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://economynext.com/chinese-firm-in-sri-lanka-admits-funding-rajapaksa-family-foundation-10832/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=SLDAIM0020180716ee7d0000i&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.google.com/maps/place/78+Rosmead+Pl,+Colombo+00700,+Sri+Lanka/@6.9144263,79.8699445,19z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ae259769e50e2b1:0x4d2479394773e775!8m2!3d6.914425!4d79.8704917; http://www.ngosecretariat.gov.lk/index.php?option=com_ngo&view=registeredlist&layout=national_list&Itemid=146&lang=en","The National Secretariat for Non-Governmental Organizations has the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation registered and includes its official address, which is in the Colombo district (made sure using google maps).

The loan carried the following terms: a variable interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.90% margin, a grace period of 4 years, a 16 year maturity, a 0.5% management fee, and a 5.9% risk (insurance) premium. 
The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.
The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71670 captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes. 
 STAFF_NOTE: The CKE is also known as the E03 expressway. Some sources identify the maturities of the China Eximbank BCLs as 16 years and the grace periods as 14 years.

Each of these China Eximbank BCLs carry the following terms: 6.3% interest rate, 15-year maturity, 3-year grace period, 0.3% management fee, 0.3% commitment fee, and a 6% exposure fee. 
 The objective of the CKE Project was to design and build a toll-charging four lane expressway that is 25.8 kilometers in length. Section A1 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 0km-4.5km (0+000 to 4 +500) segment of the expressway. Section A2 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 4.5km-10.9km (4+500 to 10+900) segment of the expressway. Section A3 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 10.9km-16.8km (10+900 to 16+800) segment of the expressway. Section A4 of the CKE Project involved the construction of the 16.8km-25.8km (16+800 to 25+800) segment of the expressway. Project ID#71664 captures the $70.042 million BCL for Section A1 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71667 captures the $63.574 million BCL for Section A2 of the CKE Project. This project captures the $47.801 million BCL for Section A3 of the CKE Project. Project ID#71672 captures the $66.783 million BCL for Section A4 of the CKE Project. 
 A contract for the construction of the CKE was initially awarded in October 2000 to a Korean construction company, but it was subsequently terminated in 2003. Then, in 2008, China Metallurgical Group Corporation was awarded a turnkey contract to construct the CKE. The proceeds from the four China Eximbank BCLs were used to pay China Metallurgical Group Corporation for its work on the A1, A2, A3, and A4 Sections of the CKE. 
 The project commenced on August 18, 2009. It was completed and the CKE was opened for public use on October 27, 2013. The CKE links the Sri Lankan capital Colombo with Bandaranaike International Airport, Katunayake and Negombo. The highway has three lanes each way from Colombo to Peliyagoda, and two lanes each way from Peliyagoda to Katunayake. The speed limit is 80 km/h (50 mph) for the first eight kilometers (5.0 mi) and 100 km/h (62 mph) for the rest of the road. The CKE has 42 bridges and 88 culverts including a 480-meter long viaduct at Hunupitiya and an 800-meter viaduct at Katunayake. The opening of the expressway has allowed people to travel between Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka and Katunayake, the major international airport of Sri Lanka, within 15 minutes. 
 STAFF_NOTE: The CKE is also known as the E03 expressway. Some sources identify the maturities of the China Eximbank BCLs as 16 years and the grace periods as 14 years.

The GCL carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. 
This first disbursement through this loan took place in 2010 and the last disbursement took place in 2014. The purpose of the project was to facilitate the procurement of thirteen, Class S12 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) for Sri Lanka Railways, and thereby strengthen the passenger transport service of Sri Lanka Railways by adding 13 DMUs to its fleet of rolling stock. Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main Line from Colombo to Badulla. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line make it difficult to operate. 
 Prior to the S12 DMUs, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. Four of the S12 DMUs were ordered to serve the Kelani Valley Line. Two of the S12 DMUs were ordered to be used for tourist transportation. The thirteen S12 DMUs were scheduled for delivery in four batch by September 2012. CRRC Sifang — a wholly-owned subsidiary of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation — was the contractor responsible for delivery of the DMUs. 
The first batch of DMUs arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012. The first Main Line train using a S12 DMU began on October 23, 2012. This project is now complete, but the exact dates of delivery of the second, third, and fourth batches are unknown.
This project facilitated the acquisition of Diesel Multiple Units for use on the Main (Railway) Line from Colombo to Badulla and the Kelani Valley Line. The Main Line starts from Colombo and runs east and north past the rapidly developing centres of Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and Polgahawela. At Rambukkana, the Main Line begins its steep climb into the hills of the upcountry. Between Balana and Kadugannawa, the track clings to the side of sheer cliffs, offering passengers views of Batalegala ('Bible' Rock). From Peradeniya Junction, a branch line reaches Kandy and Matale. The Main Line then continues its climb through tea country, connecting local market centres at Gampola, Nawalapitiya, and Hatton before reaching Nanu Oya. The Main Line continues its ascent to the summit at Pattipola, 1,898 m (6,227 ft) above sea level, before descending past Bandarawela to Badulla. The Kelani Valley line runs southeast from Colombo Maradana Station, through much of the city of Colombo. It runs through major business centres, like Nugegoda and Maharagama, before turning eastwards. It crosses the Southern Expressway near Homagama and continues east towards Avissawella, the current terminus of the line. Major railway stations on the line are Colombo Fort, Maradana, Narahenpita, Nugegoda, Maharagama, Pannipitiya, Kottawa, Homagama, Meegoda, Padukka, Waga, Kosgama, and Avissawella.
 STAFF_NOTE: The DMUs are sometimes referred to as “power sets”. China Eximbank provided a separate loan in 2007 to facilitate the procurement of 15 Diesel Multiple Units (see Project ID #33260).","Transport and Storage","http://www.erd.gov.lk/files/Parliament%20Question%20-%20Export%20Credit%2022.052014.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/pdf/performance_report_2010.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.treasury.gov.lk/reports/annualreport/AnnualReport2010-eng.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/10181/12870/2015/07e97126-41af-4d72-98ef-a0a813e83731, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20121025001511/http://www.dailynews.lk/2012/10/23/news18.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://archives.dailynews.lk/2012/10/18/news17.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://web.archive.org/web/20120908070855/http://www.dailynews.lk/2012/09/05/news21.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.china.org.cn/travel/qingdao/2017-09/15/content_41592974.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/publications/annual_report/2010/en/7_Chapter_03.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://archives.sundayobserver.lk/2010/12/05/new05.asp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.treasury.gov.lk/documents/10181/12870/2010/d104dc17-5121-4caf-a5e0-4bd775335422, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelani_Valley_line, Other; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_railway_stations_in_Sri_Lanka_by_line, Other; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Line_(Sri_Lanka), Other; http://www.erd.gov.lk/images/pdf/disbursements_in_2013_jan_to_dec.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/statistics/mbt/Monthly_Bulletin_March_2010.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","","https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1MWgzBW7Lpk_TT8gNhq1qCmYzeBg&ll=7.1641716380454294%2C80.38554466042416&z=10","Uva Province is coded in this row.
