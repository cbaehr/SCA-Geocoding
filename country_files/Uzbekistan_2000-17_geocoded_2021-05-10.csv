39943,"ICBC provides $29.2 million export buyer's credit loan for Kungrad Soda Ash Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#54832)","In 2003, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) signed a $29.23 million export buyer's credit loan agreement with Uzbek Industrial and Construction Bank (JSC Uzpromstroybank) for the construction of the Kungrad Soda Ash Plant in Uzbekistan within the autonomous republic of Karakalpakstan. The loan carried an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.5%. Sinosure provided insurance.

CITIC Group and Uzkimyosanoat were responsible for project implementation. Under the terms of its contract, Citic Pacific Ltd. designed and constructed the plant on a turnkey basis (in which CITIC would turn over the plant after a certain number of years of its operation) at a cost of $32.3 million. The plant was officially commissioned in August 2006.  This project sought to achieve a production capacity of 100,000 tons of soda ash per year  — by mining limestone from the Jamansay (Dzhamansay) quarry and the Barsakelmes field salt field in Karakalpakstan (an autonomous republic in north-western Uzbekistan). The main consumers of soda plant are Uzbek enterprises that produce household chemicals and building materials, including various types of glass.

In 2012, the capacity of the plant was expanded to 200,000 tons per year, which was partially financed by a loan from China's Eximbank (see Project ID #54832).

70304,"Chinese Government provided RMB 50 million to the Government of Uzbekistan through an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ECTA) for the Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project","In 2009, Chinese Government provided a RMB 50 million interest-free loan for Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project. On June 27, 2009, the Chinese Government committed RMB 60 million to the Government of Uzbekistan through an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ECTA). Using RMB 50 million of the proceeds from this ECTA, the Government of Uzbekistan obtained an interest-free loan for the Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project. To support this loan agreement, an inter-bank agreement was signed between China Development Bank and the National Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan on May 28, 2010. 

The Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project sought to reconstruct a Karakul district pumping station in Bukhara region (oblast). It did so by, among other things, facilitating the acquisition of pump equipment. China IPPR International Engineering Corporation was the contractor. This pump station is responsible for the irrigation of nearly 30,000 hectares of land in the Karakul region and the water supply for 769 livestock farms. During the slack season, the pump station is used to wash saline-alkali soil. The primary and auxiliary Karakul pump stations have been operating for over 40 years and 25 years, respectively, and long exceeded the normal service life of mechanical and electrical equipment. The poorly serviced equipment were no longer able to satisfy the local irrigation needs. The successful completion and operation of the Karakul Pump Station Reconstruction Project on schedule further expanded the irrigation coverage of the pump station, not only restoring and improving the agricultural irrigation and drainage conditions, but also effectively improving the salinealkali soil environment. The Karakul region, one of the most important cotton production areas of Uzbekistan, had an excellent harvest of cotton in that very year. In 2012, both the region’s irrigated cotton plantation area and output ranked second across the country and the cotton festival, which had been abandoned for over a decade, was revived, attracting over 200,000 visitors.  

This project was initiated in 2006 and completed on January 13, 2013.

The project is funded by a $177.7 million USD loan agreement with the Bank of China, under the guarantee of CNPC. The total cost of the project is $377.5 million USD.

The Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) and Uzbekneftegaz began developing three gas condensate fields in the Bukhara-Khiva region of Uzbekistan (Dengizkul, Kojadavlat, and Sharky Alat). When the three fields are developed, they will produce 869.6 million cubic meters of natural gas for exportation and 6,400 tons of gas condensate for domestic markets annually. The project was scheduled to begin in 2014, but construction began on May 30th, 2017.

The project will be implemented by three CNPC subsidiary companies: China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC) will develop the fields, designs, logistics, construction, and commissioning of facilities for the project; XIBU Drilling Engineering Company Ltd. will drill 10 production wells; and China National Logging Corporation will repair 6 wells and test production wells. 

In December 2017, the New Silk Road Oil and Gas Company Ltd (NSROG) founded as a joint venture by the CNPC and Uzbekneftegaz to oversee the project, started gas production in the Dengizkul field after the drilling of 2 new wells and repairing of 3 wells. NSROG announced that the Kojadavlat and Sharky Alat, specifically the 8 new wells and 3 damaged wells within these fields, were still under construction. A projected end date for the project has not been announced; however, construction was still occurring in September 2018.

Leading up to the 2017 development of these fields, the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development (CNODC), a subsidiary of CNPC, conducted a 5 year geologic oil survey for 359 million USD in 2006 (#54069), drilled 13 exploratory wells worth 260.2 million USD in 2011 (#39659), and 14.9 million USD for further oil exploration in 2012 (#39658).

The Oltin Yo’l GTL plant will seek to produce synthetic liquid fuels based on purified methane from Shurtan Gas Chemical Complex. The total cost of the plant is US$3.7 billion.

The Xinjiang Branch of China Development Bank (CDB) reportedly contributed $1.2 billion of debt for this project in 2017.  However, some sources indicate that the CDB also participated in the $2.3 billion syndicated loan. The costs of the project that are not covered by CDB will reportedly be covered by Uzbekneftegaz and a consortium of international financial institutions, including Export-Import Bank of Korea, Korea Trade Insurance Corporation K-SURE, Gazprombank, Russian export credit agency EXIAR, Credit Suisse, and Japanese banks MUFG, SMBC and Mizuho. Uzbekistan GTL LLC is the owner and operator of the project, while a South Korean consortium led by Hyundai Engineering & Construction company is serving as the general contractor.

The project began construction in January 29, 2017, and is expected to eventually the capacity to produce 743,500 tons of diesel fuel, 311,000 tons of aviation kerosene, 431,100 tons of naphtha and 20,900 tons of liquefied gas per year. Shurtan Gas Chemical Complex will supply the GTL plant with 3.6 billion cubic meters of methane per year. The plant is scheduled to begin service in 2020.

The China Eximbank loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, interest rate of 2.25%, commitment fee of 0.3%, and management fee of 0.3%. The Government of Uzbekistan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.

On February 11, 2014, CNTIC and CNR DLRC delivered the 11 electric freight locomotives to Uzbekiston Temir Yollari State Joint-Stock Railway Company (Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC). The locomotives were customized for use around Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent (and on the Marakand-Qarshi-Termez railway line), where temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. The cars can withstand temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius. They are produced in line with the Russian gauge of 1,520 mm, featuring high tractive power and environmentally friendly operation with a design speed of 120 km per hour.

This is the second locomotive acquisition project in Uzbekistan. The first project is captured in #40070.

The proceeds from this loan were used to support a $47.3 million contract (that was finalized in December 2011) between Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC and a consortium consisting of China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) and CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co. Ltd (CNR DLRC) for the purchase of 11 electric freight locomotives. The China Eximbank loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, interest rate of 2.25%, commitment fee of 0.3%, and management fee of 0.3%. The Government of Uzbekistan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.

On February 11, 2014, CNTIC and CNR DLRC delivered the 11 electric freight locomotives to Uzbekiston Temir Yollari State Joint-Stock Railway Company (Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC). The locomotives were customized for use around Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent (and on the Marakand-Qarshi-Termez railway line), where temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. The cars can withstand temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius. They are produced in line with the Russian gauge of 1,520 mm, featuring high tractive power and environmentally friendly operation with a design speed of 120 km per hour.

This is the second locomotive acquisition project in Uzbekistan. The first project is captured in #40070.

On February 11, 2014, CNTIC and CNR DLRC delivered the 11 electric freight locomotives to Uzbekiston Temir Yollari State Joint-Stock Railway Company (Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC). The locomotives were customized for use around Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent (and on the Marakand-Qarshi-Termez railway line), where temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. The cars can withstand temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius.

The proceeds from this loan were used to support a $47.3 million contract (that was finalized in December 2011) between Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC and a consortium consisting of China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) and CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co. Ltd (CNR DLRC) for the purchase of 11 electric freight locomotives. The China Eximbank loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, interest rate of 2.25%, commitment fee of 0.3%, and management fee of 0.3%. The Government of Uzbekistan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.

On February 11, 2014, CNTIC and CNR DLRC delivered the 11 electric freight locomotives to Uzbekiston Temir Yollari State Joint-Stock Railway Company (Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC). The locomotives were customized for use around Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent (and on the Marakand-Qarshi-Termez railway line), where temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. The cars can withstand temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius. They are produced in line with the Russian gauge of 1,520 mm, featuring high tractive power and environmentally friendly operation with a design speed of 120 km per hour.

This is the second locomotive acquisition project in Uzbekistan. The first project is captured in #40070.

The proceeds from this loan were used to support a $47.3 million contract (that was finalized in December 2011) between Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC and a consortium consisting of China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) and CNR Dalian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Co. Ltd (CNR DLRC) for the purchase of 11 electric freight locomotives. The China Eximbank loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, interest rate of 2.25%, commitment fee of 0.3%, and management fee of 0.3%. The Government of Uzbekistan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan.

On February 11, 2014, CNTIC and CNR DLRC delivered the 11 electric freight locomotives to Uzbekiston Temir Yollari State Joint-Stock Railway Company (Uzbekistan Railways SJSRC). The locomotives were customized for use around Uzbekistan's capital of Tashkent (and on the Marakand-Qarshi-Termez railway line), where temperatures can drop to minus 20 degrees Celsius in winter. The cars can withstand temperatures as low as minus 30 degrees Celsius. They are produced in line with the Russian gauge of 1,520 mm, featuring high tractive power and environmentally friendly operation with a design speed of 120 km per hour.

This is the second locomotive acquisition project in Uzbekistan. The first project is captured in #40070.

Staff_Note: The Russian name of this project is ""Обновление парка локомотивов ГАЖК ""Узбекистон темир йуллари”.
