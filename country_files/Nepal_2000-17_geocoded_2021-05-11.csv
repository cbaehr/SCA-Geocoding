34399,"China pledges to build USD13.8M Nepal dry port","In 2012, China signed an agreement with Nepal to build a dry port in Nepal's Larcha, near Tatopani customs on the northern border with China, and will cost an estimated Rs 1.2 billion (13.8 million USD, 86.2 million RMB) and funded with Chinese grant. 27.5 million square feet of land has been allocated near Tatopani for the port, parking for up to 200 trucks, agricultural quarantine, inspection house, warehouses, and a customs office. The government of Nepal has assigned the Inter-modal Transport Development Board to facilitate all the construction work which will be done by China’s Beijing Real Estate Group Company. Under the project, a border inspection building, cargo warehouse, litigation-warehouse, a parking lot with a capacity of accommodating at least 158 big containers and 33 cars and a 112-meter-long bridge over the Bhotekoshi River will be constructed. China had also agreed to upgrade a 6.5 km road connecting the dry port to the border with China. Construction began in December 2012 and was expected to be completed within 2 and a half years. The construction project is expected to ease the bottleneck for surging trade between China and Nepal. 

As of November 2014, the completion of the dry port will be delayed as a result of transportation problems created by a landslide in Jure, Sindhupalchok, and the sweeping away of the Bhotekoshi bridge by floods. The bridge was crucial to transporting construction materials to the dry port. The government has also failed to clear houses along the road connecting Miteri Bridge and the dry port. The road expansion and construction of a bridge over Bhotekoshi are included in the dry port contract. At this point only 60-65 percent of the construction work has been completed. Technical experts at the project say at the current pace of work, it will take another one year from the deadline to complete the project.","Trade and Tourism","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020090113e51c0004e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2012/12/20/money/larcha-dry-port-construction-begins/243137.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=72732, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://en.people.cn/90883/8066638.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.ekantipur.com/2014/11/20/business/larcha-dry-port-completion-to-be-delayed-by-one-year/397942.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://np.chineseembassy.org/eng/News/t946364.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.nepalmountainnews.com/cms/2012/12/12/dry-port-construction-to-begin-at-nepal-china-border/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://myrepublica.com/portal/index.php?action=news_details&news_id=88563, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.tibetanreview.net/china-to-build-dry-port-for-nepal-near-tibet-border/, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/aa/?ref=PRTRIN0020090113e51c0004e&pp=1&fcpil=en&napc=S&sa_from=, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","","good","district",81.14,29.27,"Seti","Administrative Zone","NPL.3.2_1","Nepal"

This project involved the construction of of a 16 km stretch of road along the Galchhi-Trishuli-Rasuwagadhi Highway that runs from the Tibetan border town of Kyirong (in Rasuwagadi) to Syaphrubesi. Syaphrubesi is connected with Dhunche, the headquarters of Rasuwa district, and Trishuli Bazar, the district headquarters of Nuwakot district, by a motorable road. The highway construction project sought to link Nepal with Tibet's Kyirong, which lies next to Rasuwagadi. It was also expected to shorten the distance between Nepal and Lhasa, the capital of Tibetan Autonomous Region of China. Upon completion, it was expected that this highway would be the shortest road link to China from Nepal. Construction of this road began on December 17, 2007 and it was completed December 26, 2012.

The terms of the loan were as follows: 1.75% interest rate, 25-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The Government of Nepal used the proceeds of the loan to develop an on-lending arrangement (through a “Subsidiary Loan Agreement”) with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) on April 15, 2011. These loan agreements went into effect on June 1, 2011. 

However, in 2013, the scope of the project was expanded and the face value of these loan agreements were increased to $114.7 million. The Upper Trishuli 3A hydroelectric power plant project involved the construction a 60 MW run-of-river (ROR) plant with annual energy generation of 460 GWh. The plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. On May 31, 2010, China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC) signed a commercial (EPC) contract with NEA to implement all civil, electro-mechanical, and hydro-mechanical works, including gradation of the 11.5 km long access road, construction of a steel bridge over Trishuli River, construction of temporary camp at headworks, and excavation of Adit no. 1 and head pond excavation. Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited (previously known as Northwest HydroConsulting Engineers) was selected as the contractor responsible for construction supervision. CGGC received a “Commencement of Work Order” on June 1, 2011. 

The project was initiated on November 23, 2011 and it encountered various delays due to disputes over whether to build powerhouse underground or overground, disputes about whether to increase the capacity of the project, damages to the access roads leading to the project site (resulting from landslides that were triggered by an April 2015 earthquake), and a blockade imposed by India. On May 26, 2019, the first unit of the plant was successfully connected to the grid.  The second unit was successfully connected to the grid later in 2019. The hydroelectric power plant was officially completed and inaugurated on November 18, 2019. The electricity that is now generated by the plant mainly serves people in Kathmandu and it reportedly fulfills seven percent of the country’s total electricity demand. 

The 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. The exact coordinates of the power plant can be found at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Upper+Trishuli+3A+Powerhouse/@28.117778,84.6364041,10z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sUpper+Trishuli+3A!3m4!1s0x39eadbf2740c67c7:0x15a04724da9278bd!8m2!3d28.0255896!4d85.1860467.

53125,"Chinese Government provides RMB 124 million grant for the Timure (Rasuwagadi) Frontier Inspection Station Project","In October 2014, China conducted a feasibility study for the Timure (Rasuwagadi) Frontier Inspection Station Project and signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for the development of an Inland Container Depot (ICD) in Nepal. Then, on April 11, 2015, the Chinese Government and the Government of Nepal signed letters of exchange to construct the Inland Container Depot (ICD) in the town of Timure within Rasuwagadi District. China agreed to cover all the expenses except the costs of land acquisition. The 6,900 m² ICD will include two warehouses for storage and investigation before clearing, three quarantine check points for animals, plants and food testing, a parking lot for 315 freight vehicles, separate terminals for import and export, and food protection levee. China will also provide equipment for inspection and other infrastructure such as water tanks. 

On November 15, 2015, China sent a technical team to conduct the inspection of the site for construction. Nepal Intermodal Transport Development Board also acquired 8.5 hectares land for the project: 5 hectares from Langtang National Park and 3.5 hectares from the general public. The Chinese state-owned company, Architectural Reconnaissance and Design Institute of the Tibet Autonomous Region, oversaw the design of the ICD. Construction was expected to begin in October 2018; however, as of October 27, 2018, the construction had still not begun. Tibet Fuli Construction Group Company Limited was selected as the contractor responsible for project implementation on May 13, 2019.  Project implementation then began on May 29, 2019.

This customs inspection station is located in Timure, a small town and the headquarter of ward no. 2 of the Gosaikund rural municipality in Rasuwa district on the country’s border with China.

38347,"Chinese Government provides $13.6 million grant for the Tatopani Frontier Inspection Station Project","On September 10, 2009, the Chinese Government agreed to provide a $13,637,514 grant to build an expanded customs inspection station at Tatopani on Nepal’s northern border through an exchange of letters that it signed with the Government of Nepal. Then, in June 2011, the Chinese Government signed another agreement to construct the Tatopani (Zhangmu) Customs Inspection Station near the dry port (also known as an inland clearance depot or ICD) at Larcha and hand it over to the Government of Nepal after completion. 

The project involved the installation of different facilities to ease customs clearance, such as a cargo warehouse, parking lot, and a digital truck scale to weigh goods. The purpose of the project was to improve the border customs clearance conditions and ease the flow of vehicles and people in the border areas in Nepal and to promote the development of bilateral trade between two countries. Beijing Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (北京房地集团承) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project, and on December 20, 2012, construction commenced. However, during project implementation, the Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) in Larcha was ravaged by floods and earthquakes. Beijing Real Estate Development Group reportedly abandoned the project in 2015. The project was resumed in April 2018, and, according to CGTN, was completed by China Railway 14th Contruction Bureau Co. According to ""China Aid Post-Quake Reconstruction Projects in Nepal,"" the project was completed and opened in April 2019.

The Government of Nepal’s Aid Information Management System (AMIS) records the official grant commitment amount of $13,637,514 as being fully disbursed between May 17, 2012 and November 21, 2017. AMIS also identifies an additional $81,114 in disbursement for this project that exceeded the original grant commitment amount.
