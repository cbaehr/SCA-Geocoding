Based on an interview with Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister Fu Yings, this was the second 150 million CNY-grant that was offered by China. The agreement to provide the first 150 million CNY worth of grant was signed on 31 December 2011 (See Project ID#34601). Minister Fu Yings also said that China and Afghanistan would identify projects that could use the grant. A Joint Declaration between The People's Republic of China and The Islamic Republic of Afghanistan on Establishing Strategic and Cooperative Partnership was then released on June 16 2012 which stated that both sides will 'continually strengthen the pragmatic cooperation in such fields as resources and energy development, infrastructure development, engineering and agriculture'. It was also suggested that the grant will be going to 'peaceful reconstruction process'.

The amount of the grant is unknown. The reconstruction handover ceremony was held on September 17, 2016. 

There are nearly 4,000 students in a school in Tahgwa, including 1,800 girls. Due to the poor state of school buildings, the limited number of classrooms can only accommodate students in batches. After the completion of the school reconstruction project, the classroom windows of the two schools were equipped with glass; the roof was reinforced and made rainproof; private toilets were installed. and the new school building greatly improved the enthusiasm of local residents to send their children to school.

(RPCL) and NORINCO Intl. in 2017 to oversee the financing, design, and construction of this power plant. RPCL is a Bangladeshi state-owned electrification enterprise and NORINCO Intl. is a Chinese state-owned arms manufacturing company. The two state-owned enterprises registered their venture, RPCL-NORINCO Intl. Power Ltd. (RNPL) with the Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs Registrar of Joint Stock Companies and Firms on December 27, 2017. 

The total cost of the project is approximately $2.5 billion. It is reportedly being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. RPCL and NORINCO each hold 50% equity shares in the project company. At the time of creation, RNPL had 200,000,000 BDT, with a maximum authorized capital of 400,000,000 BDT. The value of the Chinese equity funding is unclear. Since NORINCO held 50% of RNPL‚Äôs equity, the NORINCO funding may equal 100,000,000 BDT (approximately 1.2 million USD in December 2017). However, since the total project cost is 2.5 billion USD, and NORINCO owns half of the 30% equity share in the project company, NORINCO‚Äôs equity contribution could be as high as 15% of $2.5 billion, or $375 million USD. To avoid inaccurately representing the value of this investment, no transaction amount is recorded for the equity portion of this project for the time being (reported in Project ID #56357). 

China Eximbank is providing the debt financing for this project. Its loan to RNPL reportedly carries a 4% interest rate, 5 year grace period, and 20-year maturity. Project ID#56402 only captures the debt financing that came from the China Eximbank loan. The precise face value of the China Eximbank loan is unknown. However, RNPL has stated that the total project cost is $2.5 billion and that 70% of the funding would come from the China Eximbank loan, which implies a  value of $1.75 billion. During the implementation of the 1320 (2 x 600) MW Patuakhali Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project, RNPL will construct a coal jetty, coal import-handling facilities, coal storage, the power plant, transmission facilities, roads, and the town surrounding the plant. The project will process 12273 tons of coal per day and sell power to the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). 

This power plant will operate on 915.74 acres of land. The plant will displace 350 families, so RPCL will set up a village with schools, shops, community centers, and mosques. On March 6, 2019, RNPL signed an EPC contract with NORINCO International Cooperation Ltd. and it issued a notice to proceed (NTP) to the EPC contractor on August 31, 2019.

NWPGCL and CMC each reportedly will provide 50% of the equity financing for this project. This project only tracks the debt funding. Project ID #56005 captures the equity funding for this project. China Eximbank covered the remaining 80% of the project through debt financing. On December 29, 2016, the China Eximbank and BCPCL signed a $1.984 billion loan agreement to support the construction of the 1320MW Payra Coal-Fired Thermal Power Plant Project. This loan reportedly carries the following terms: 19-year maturity, 4 year grace period, an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2% margin (which we estimate as 3.306% at the time of commitment since 1.306% was the average 6-month LIBOR rate in December 2016). The Government of Bangladesh provided a $1 billion sovereign guarantee for this loan on December 31, 2017. 

The Payra power plant is located in Dhankhali, Patuakhali, Bangladesh. This places the power plant along the north side of the Payra port, which will be renovated by the China Harbour Company and the China State Construction Engineering Corporation (see Project ID #55522). Phase one of the project involves the construction of units one and two. Each unit will have a capacity of 660 MW, so phase one has a combined capacity of 1320 MW.  In December 2017, BPDB contracted China Energy Engineering Group Northeast No. 1 Electric Power Construction Co., Ltd. (NPEC) and China National Energy Engineering & Construction Co., Ltd. (CECC) to construct the power plants. The project was officially launched on October 27, 2018. The power plant became operational on January 13, 2020.  A consortium led by the China Datang Overseas Electric Technology and O&M Co. Ltd. will carry out operations and maintenance of the power plant.  Once operational, this power plant will sell energy to the BPDB at a cost of 6.56 BDT per unit of energy.

However, the project was finished ahead of schedule on May 27, 2018.

On July 22, 2018, the Barapukuria coal-fired power plant was shut down after the discovery of the ‚ÄúBarapukuria coal scam‚Äù, which was a corruption scandal concerning the misappropriation of around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal, worth over BDT 227 billion by officials of Barapukuria Coal Mining Company Limited (BCMCL) from the coal mine of Barapukuria, Dinajpur District, in northern Bangladesh. The scandal was revealed in July 2018 when a board member of the Bangladesh Power Development Board went to visit the coal mine and found no fresh coal whereas according to the document there should have been around 142 hundred thousand tons of coal reserved. The matter came to light when a Bangladeshi English-language daily reported the incident. 

Petrobangla, the parent organization of the BCMCL, promptly suspended a few officials in this connection while the Anti-Corruption Commission started an inquiry to trace the corruption. Barapukuria's coal-fired power plant suspended its operations due to the shortage of coal as an immediate effect of the corruption scandal. Before the shutdown of the plant, it had been supplying around 380MW power to the national grid on an average. When the power plant shut down the first time, the people of eight northern districts of Rangpur and Dinajpur regions suffered from a lack of electricity.  BPDB then decided to restart one of its units for five days on August 20, 2018. On August 28, 2018, the plant shut down again.

The Government of Bangladesh reports that the project will cost a total of 11.453 billion BDT (taka), of which 7.052 billion BDT (taka) will be granted by the Chinese Government. Upon completion, it is expected that the bridge will play an important role in accelerating the movement of people and goods between Barisal and Khulna divisions. China Railway Major Bridge Reconnaissance & Design Institute Co., Ltd. (BRDI), a subsidiary of China Railway Group Limited, is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on November 1, 2018, and the expected project completion date is January 1, 2021. Upon completion, this 1500 meter bridge will run over the Kocha River in Bekutia within Pirojpur District. It is located at the 12th km of Rajapur-Naikati-Bekutia Pirojpur Road (Z-8702 or the Rajapur-Pirojpur Expressway). At the moment, a ferry is operated on the Kocha river and it takes more than an hour to cross the river.

"176",53584,"China Eximbank provides a $467.8 million preferential buyer's credit for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project ID#38349)","On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh.

Through this project, a diesel and crude oil storage tank will be set up at Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.

The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. 

The PBC is captured here, in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured in Project ID#38349. The China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‚Äúeffective‚Äù until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong. 

 In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. 

As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM.

"177",38349,"China Eximbank provides RMB 569.6 million government concessional loan for Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project (Linked to Project #53584)","On October 29, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh signed a framework agreement for the Installation of Single Point Mooring (SPM) with Double Pipe Line Project. Under the terms of this framework agreement, China Eximbank pledged to provide a preferential buyers' credit (PBC) worth $467,840,000 and a government concessional loan (GCL) worth RMB 569,664,000 for the construction of an oil tanker mooring platform and a 200km underwater and onshore pipeline in Chittagong, Bangladesh. 

The project was launched because Bangladesh is not capable of handling large vessels carrying imported crude and finished oil, due to the low navigability of a key river channel and constrained facilities at the main seaport in Chittagong. The single point mooring system, once constructed, will help to offload 1.2 lakh tonnes of crude oil within only 48 hours and 70,000 tonnes of diesel in 28 hours. Its annual capacity to offload oil will be nine million tonnes, and it will be able to save Tk800 crore per year. Upon project completion, liquid fuel oil will be carried to Moheshkhali Island, on the Bay of Bengal in Bangladeshi Cox's Bazar district, through the pipeline from large tankers anchored in the deep sea. Later, the 110-km pipelines installed under the Bay of Bengal and in coastal areas will directly carry the oil to the Eastern Refinery in Chattogram from Moheshkhali. The project also involves the construction of a 146-km offshore pipeline and 74-km onshore pipeline to carry imported oil from the sea to a refinery in Chittagong district, some 242 km southeast of Dhaka, for processing.

The PBC is captured in Project ID#53661, while the GCL is captured here, in Project ID#38349. China Eximbank and the Government of Bangladesh finalized the PBC and GCL agreements on November 3, 2017; however, the loans did not become ‚Äúeffective‚Äù until April 2018. The GCL reportedly carries a 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, and 5 year grace period. The terms of the PBC are unknown. 

China Petroleum Pipeline Bureau, which is a subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC), is the contractor responsible for constructing the oil tanker mooring platform as well as establishing the 146 km of the pipeline under the Bay of Bengal to the coast. An additional 74km onshore pipeline will also connect to new storage tanks and Bangladesh's only oil refinery in Chittagong.  In January 2015, CPPB, a subsidiary of the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation, and the Energy Division under the Ministry of Power, Energy and Mineral Resources signed an agreement to build a single point mooring system (SPM) in the Bay of Bengal to carry petroleum from vessels at the outer anchorage to depots onshore. 

Upon completion of the project, fuel unloading time will reportedly be shortened from the original 11 days to two and a half. This project will also seek to reduce lower fuel costs and the risk of oil spills. As of March 2015, the state-run Eastern Refinery Ltd (ERL) had received a technical offer from the CPPB to build the SPM. Before submitting the technical offer, a team of the CPPB visited the project location near Moheshkhali Island in the Bay of Bengal and found the site suitable. The ERL, along with an international consultant, was expected to review the 'lone' technical offer before submitting its evaluation report to the Energy and Mineral Resources Division (EMRD) under the ministry of power, energy, and mineral resources (MPEMR).

The syndicated buyer‚Äôs credit loan agreement with China Eximbank and ICBC carries the following terms: 12-year maturity, 2 year grace period, and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.19% margin (3.593% at the time of the signing of the loan agreement). Loan repayments are sent to China Eximbank and ICBC every 6 months, with the first payment taking place in July 2016. The Government of Bangladesh provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan on October 23, 2013. 

BR Powergen Limited was established as a public limited company by Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) and Rural Power Company Limited (RPCL) under the Power Division of the Government of Bangladesh‚Äôs Ministry of Power, Energy, and Mineral Resources. BPDB and RPCL each hold a 50% ownership stake in BR Powergen Limited. 

China National Electric Import & Export Corporation, Jiangsu Construction Engineering Company, and Fujian Electric Power Engineering Company formed a consortium to construct the power plant. BR Powergen signed their engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract with this consortium on January 3, 2013. The proceeds of the syndicated buyer‚Äôs credit loan were intended to pay for 85% of the EPC contract value. Then, on November 3, 2013, BR Powergen signed a Power Purchase Agreement with the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB). It also signed a fuel supply agreement on December 5, 2013. Construction of the Kodda Power Plant began on January 28, 2014, and it was put into commercial operation on August 15, 2015. 

The plant runs on two fuel sources: heavy fuel oil and gas. According to B-R Powergen's 2017-2018 Annual Report, the EPC contract with the consortium of Chinese firms was worth $155,842,358.61. The project had an additional cost of R8,224,274.00 for insurance, which BR Powergen paid to the Ministry of Finance of Bangladesh. BR Powergen and the Ministry of Finance signed their agreement on October 23, 2013. Staff Note: At the start of 2017, BR Powergen still owed 9,988,130,809 BDT. During 2017, they paid 1,024,418,309 BDT, but the outstanding debt increased by 76,589,003 BDT to adjust for foreign exchange risk. During 2018, BR Powergen paid 1,066,105,994 BDT, reducing its outstanding debt to 7,974,195,509 BDT. MAN Diesel & Turbo SE of Germany manufactured the plant's engine.

Finnvera is covering a total of $46.9 million with Sinosure guaranteeing the remainder. Both guarantees effectively reinsure a 100% sovereign guarantee from the Bangladeshi government, which owns BPDB. China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation was the accountable party of the credit agreement. 

The proceeds of the loan are being used to finance the EPC contract and turbine procurement from Hubei Electric Power Survey and Design Institute and Wartsila Finland.

The proceeds of the 2015 syndicated loan from the Bank of China and the Export-Import Bank of China only supported the installation of the second unit of electricity generators (‚ÄúSirajganj 2‚Äù, which passed the final inspection tests in February 2018. The second unit of the power plant began commercial operations on February 5, 2018.  The project involved the construction, installation, and operation of a 225 MW dual-fuel CCPP (similar to Sirajganj 1) within the Sirajganj Power Complex, comprising a dual-fuel gas turbine, generator, steam turbine and a heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), water treatment and cooling system, as well as the construction of a 230 kV switchyard and an extension of the existing 230 kV switching station within the Sirajganj Power Complex. The project utilized the existing jetty for unloading heavy equipment, access roads, and water treatment and cooling systems that were constructed for Sirajganj 1. 

The project is located about 15 km south-east of Sirajganj town and 130 km north-west of Dhaka. The closest settlements to the project site, Boroshimul & Ponchosona, are both located approximately 1 km from the power plant complex. Natural gas, the main fuel for the project, will be supplied by Petrobangla, and there are already existing pipelines servicing the power plant complex for the Sirajganj 1 Project. Power from the project will be evacuated to the national grid through the existing 230kV switching station beside the project site.

It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).

This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Lines A and B, which are sometimes referred to as parts of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. Project ID#39997 records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C. Line A and Line B begin on right bank of the Amu Darya River, near Turkmen-Uzbek border, before passing through central Uzbekistan and south Kazakhstan (see “中国-中亚天然气管道简介”). Construction of the Kazakhstani section of the pipeline commenced on July 9, 2008. As of October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually (see “Flow of natural gas from Central Asia”).

In October 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the development, construction, and operation of lines A and B of the pipeline. The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + 2.15% per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + 2.9% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until October 22, 2023. The amounts due under this loan were secured by account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $4 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.84 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as the 3-month LIBOR in October 2008, 4.059%, + 2.15%, or 6.209%, while grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.

On September 26, 2011, the Chinese Government signed an agreement on free technical assistance with the Government of Kazakhstan. China agreed to provide a grant of pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan for renewable energy projects (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan""). The equipment from the grant was to enable the construction of a 1 MW solar power plant (SES) and a 5 MW wind farm (WES) (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants"").

The 5 MW wind farm consisted of two wind power plants with a capacity of 2.5 MW each, with project electricity generation of 17 million kWh per year. The construction period was from March to November 2018 (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants""). The wind farms had 80-meter tall towers and a 53.8-meter long blades that could generate electricity at wind speeds of 3 m/s to 25 m/s. The 5MW wind power plant was to be built in the Yenbekshikazakhsky District of the Almaty Region over an area of 25 ha (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan"").

The 1 MW solar power station, located in the special economic zone “Park of Innovative Technologies” (or “IT Park”) in the Almaty Region, produced electricity by poly- and single-crystal photoelectric modules, with a projected electricity generation of 1.4 million kW/h per year. The construction period was from December 2017 to October 2018 (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants""). The solar plant featured 1,716 monocrystalline panels with a capacity of 285 W and 1,892 polycrystalline panels. The power generated from these plants was sold in the network of JSC “Almaty Power Plants” (see ""Solar and wind power plants were commissioned in Almaty and Almaty region"").

According to the agreement, the Chinese side was to deliver, assemble, and commission the equipment at its own expense, while Kazakhstan was to exempt the equipment from customs duties and taxes (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan""). The general contractor for the projects was CITIC Construction Group, and the operators of the wind and solar plants were “Samruk-Energy” JSC and Powerchina Zhongnan Engineering Corp. Ltd. The two 2.5 MW wind farms were produced by the Chinese company Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co., Ltd. (see ""Solar and wind power plants were commissioned in Almaty and Almaty region""). “Samruk-Green Energy” LLP supervised the construction of projects in order to ensure timely fulfillment of obligations under the agreement (see ""Solar and wind power plants were commissioned in Almaty and Almaty region"").

It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","","ADM1",77.96,44.96,"Almaty","Region","KAZ.1_1","Kazakhstan"

The project sought to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, allowing the speed limit to be up to 120 km/h. In addition to CITIC Construction, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy performed work on the project (see ""Reconstruction Works on Taldykorgan – Kalbatau – Ust-Kamenogorsk Road km 615-1073 in Eastern-Kazakhstan Oblast""). On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

"303",40162,"China Development Bank provides a $200 million USD loan for the 300 MW Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Project","In June 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $200 million USD export buyer's credit loan agreement with the Moynak Hydroelectric Power Station Joint Stock Company (JSC) for the 300 MW Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Plant Project (also known as the Moinak Hydro Power Plant or Мойнақ СЭС-і). (see ""中哈总理见证公司签约哈萨克斯坦建国以来最大水电站项目""; ""Experience""; and ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The Government of Kazakhstan established the Moynak Hydro-Electric Power Station JSC in 2005 to own and operate the hydroelectric plant (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The Government of Kazakhstan provided a guarantee for repayment of one half of the amount (see ""Kazakhstan’s Electric Power Sector: New Challenges and Opportunities""). The construction of the 300 MW hydroelectric plant had a total cost of $346.6 million USD. In addition to the $200 million CDB loan, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK)  provided loans worth $118.6 million USD, while Moynak Hydro-Electric Power Station JSC contributed $28 million USD (see ""Information on Moynak HPP JSC"").

Construction on the plant had started in 1985 but then stopped in 1992 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the CDB financing, construction on the power plant started anew. The Moynak plant was designed to house two 150 MW turbines that could generate 1.27 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The project sought to end energy shortages in southern Kazakhstan with its reliable energy, enabling growth in the industrial sector of the region (see ""Analysis: Kazakhstan's hydroelectric potential attracts foreign investment"").

China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC), and Chengdu Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute (CHIDI) jointly implemented the Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Project (see ""中国公司在哈萨克斯坦承建的水电站引水隧洞贯通""). The project included the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, commissioning, training, and maintenance for the plant, with a quality assurance period for major equipment of 20 years (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The station was expected to be completed and put into operation in December 2009 (see ""公司获准承建哈萨克斯坦第一个自主开发水电站工程""). The launching ceremony of construction was held on August 8, 2008 (see ""陆国俊总经理出席玛依纳水电站工程启动仪式""). The Moynak hydropower plant was commissioned on December 9, 2011. In 2012, it generated 503,98 million kWh of electricity (see ""History of the company"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of the power station is 联营体承建的哈萨克斯坦玛依纳水电站. Another alternative name in English is “Construction of Moynak HPP on Charyn river.” Moynak is also spelled ""Moinak.""

The power station was located in the village of Moynak near the town of Kegen, approximately 200 km from Almaty, along the Charyn (also spelled Sharyn) River in Almaty Region.

The estimated cost of the project was $34.4 million USD (₸11.7 billion KZT) (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). The Chinese Government provided 50% of the financing for the project, or $17.2 million USD, while the Government of Kazakhstan provided the other 50% (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). China was set to own 50% of the dam after completion, while the other half would be property of Kazakhstan (see ""Kazakhstan, China to jointly build dam on Khorgos river""). The Parliament of Kazakhstan ratified the agreement on June 21, 2018 (see ""Kazakhstan's Parliament ratifies agreement with China on construction of dike"").

The mudflow dam was located on Khorgos River 5 kilometers upstream from the Kazakh-Chinese joint Dostyk Hydraulic Power System, in the small town of Dostyk in the Almaty Region on the border with China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The dam was intended to protect the Khorgos International Center for Cross-Border Cooperation, the Dostyk Hydraulic Power System, the Baskunchi and Khorgos settlements, the Atasu-Alashankou oil pipeline, road and railway bridges, and the people living in the river's lower basin, from mudflows and floods. The Committee for Emergency Situations of Kazakh Ministry of Internal Affairs and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps were responsible for the dam. Experts from both countries performed cost estimates and created designs for the project. A Kazakh-China committee was to be established to manage the construction process, while the operation and management was to be determined by a later agreement (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River"").

The construction of the dam included a central reinforced concrete section (featuring the necessary metal structures), an earth part of the dam, a control and measuring system, and a temporary cofferdam and drainage channel for passing water during the construction period, as well as 200-meter shore protection structures (dams) under the dam (see ""Kazakhstan and China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). The dam was designed to intercept mudflows of up to 9.8 million cubic meters (see ""Kazakh-Chinese dam to protect ICBC Khorgos""). Part of the dam was located on Chinese territory (see ""ПОЗДРАВЛЯЕМ!""). Construction began on April 18, 2019 (see ""АЛМАТЫ ОБЛЫСЫНЫҢ ҚОРҒАС ӨЗЕНІНДЕ «ШҰҚЫРБҰЛАҚ»..."").

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan.

JSC - a 100% subsidiary of Kazakh state-owned JSC Tau-Ken Samruk, National Mining Company of Kazakhstan - to partially finance the Shalkiya Zinc and Lead Mine Expansion Project. The EBRD was the lead arranger of the loan syndicate; Bank of China Kazakhstan provided $120 million USD and EBRD provided $175 million USD respectively. (see ""Bank of China to participate in EBRD Shalkiya Zinc syndicated loan""). Under the terms of this syndicated loan agreement, the principal debt was to be repaid in equal installments every six months beginning on June 20, 2021. The loan must be fully repaid as of December 20, 2029. Therefore, the loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 3.5 years, in addition to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.5 % annual interest margin. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided an irrevocable guarantee for the loan. The commission and reservation fees, paid by ShalkiyaZink Ltd. to EBRD in 2017, totaled ₸1,153,624 thousand KZT (see pg.167 of ""Annual Report 2017"").

The Zinc Mine Reconstruction and Expansion Project sought to expand the mining operations at the existing Shalkiya lead-zinc mine and construct a beneficiation plant at
the facility. Shalkiya lead-zinc deposit was one of the largest in Kazakhstan and was expected to produce 4 million tons of ore per year. The project intended to to introduce the latest technologies in the field of extraction and production, including a vertical ore hoisting conveyor, to the project. A new concentrating mill, tailing dump, intrasite networks, ore-issuing complex and carrying out mining and capital works at the Shalkiya mine were all included (see pg.3 and 167 of ""Annual Report 2017""). After completion of the reconstruction and expansion of the mine, it was expected that ShalkiyaZink Ltd. JSC would become the top zinc mining company in Kazakhstan, and one of the world's top zinc mining companies, developing the local economy, offering employment, and inducing development in upstream and downstream industries in Kazakhstan. The Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan was to provide infrastructure services for the smooth implementation of the project (see ""哈萨克中国银行向哈锌矿项目提供1.2亿美元贷款【哈通社中文网】""). The EPC contractor responsible for project implementation was German company Engineering Dobersek GmbH. In 2018, construction was scheduled to begin in 2020 (see ""SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND SAMRUK-KAZYNA SIGNS..."")

The Shalkiya Mine is located in the territory of the Zhanakorgan District of Kyzylorda Region in Kazakhstan. The Shalkiya mining site is rather flat with some decline to the west towards the Syr Darya River. Code fixes of the mine are 67 degrees 25 minutes of east longitude and 44 degrees 01 minutes of north latitude. The mine is 15 kilometers north-west from Zhanakorgan settlement. The regional center of Zhanakorgan is connected by roads and railways to the rest of Kazakhstan, through the city of Shymkent – with Uzbekistan and China and through Kyzylorda – with Russia (see pg.12 of ""ShalkiyaZinc N.V.

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","https://www.gem.wiki/Central_Asia-China_Gas_Pipeline#Location_.28Lines_A.2CB.2CC.29","ADM1",68.51,43.2,"South Kazakhstan","Region","KAZ.12_1","Kazakhstan"

Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). This project captures the CDB contribution; for the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384.

This 1,454 km pipeline runs through the Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.

"334",39997,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan for the Kazakhstani Section of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline (Linked to Project ID#40833, #39955, #54489, #54528, and #70616)","The Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, also known as the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline or, simply, the Asia Gas Pipeline, is a 1,873-km long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, delivering gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","","ADM1",72.2,44.29,"Zhambyl","Region","KAZ.14_1","Kazakhstan"

The project included the construction of six bridges, three overpasses over rail lines, 11 illuminated traffic intersections, 276 culverts, recreation areas, and auto pavilions. The project was expected to be completed in June 2022 (see ""В Жамбылской области началась реализация...""). China XinXing Construction Development Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 26, 2019 (see ""新兴建设承建的哈萨克斯坦MB266国家级公路改造项目举行开工典礼"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#55016), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

"289",70646,"China Development Bank provides a $100 million USD loan to Chem-Plus LLP for the production of caustic soda in the Chemical Park Taraz Special Economic Zone","In June 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $100 million loan agreement with Chem-Plus LLP to finance the production of caustic soda. The loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 10 years and an interest of 4.7% per annum (pg.27 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год""). The project had a total cost of ₸47.6 billion KZT (approximately $142.8 million USD in 2017); thus, this project was co-financed (see ""Айдын Рахимбаев возглавил ренкинг крупнейших получателей господряда в Казахстане"").

The project was located in Chemical Park Taraz Special Economic Zone in the Shu District of the Jambyl Region (see ""Astana hosts fourth meeting of Kazakhstan-China Business Council""). The project sought to construct a caustic soda line at the Formulation Complex, intended for the production and sale of plant protection products (herbicides) for the Kazakhstani market (see ""Actual projects - Chem-Plus LLP""). It was to be capable of producing 40,000 tons. The commissioning was planned for 2020. Construction had begun by 2017, but it had been suspended until a decision was made on the further implementation of the project's fourth start-up glyphosate complex (pg.34 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год"").

A consortium led by Kazakhstani company Construction Corporation Kulager LLP was awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the project on November 20, 2017 (see pg.19 of ""Chem-plus LLP Financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 together with independent auditor's report""). In addition to Kulager LLP, the consortium featured German company Chemieanlagenbau Chemnitz GmbH, Kazakhstani company Promstroyproekt Design Institute LLP and Kazakhstani company Aral Service LLP (pg.8 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год""). The construction was on-going as of December 31, 2018 (see pg.16 of ""Chem-plus LLP Financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 together with independent auditor's report""). The complex was commissioned in January 2019, but it appears that the caustic soda line had not gone into production (see ""Actual projects - Chem-Plus LLP"").

The shareholders of Chem-Plus LLP were Kazakh state-owned enterprises: United Chemical Company LLP (99.87% ownership stake) and Samruk-Kaazyna Invest LLP (.13% ownership stake) (see pg.14 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год"").

(Linked to Project ID#73437)","In 2015, National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC signed a $1.5 billion USD syndicated term loan facility to partially finance the purchase of 50% of the shares of KMG Kashagan B.V. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was one of the mandated lead arrangers. The loan captured a maturity period of five years (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agree to extend loan term on KMG Kashagan B.V. project""). On October 16, 2015, Samruk-Kazyna purchased 50% of the shares in KMG Kashagan B.V. from Coöperatieve KazMunaiGaz U.A for $4.7 billion USD; thus, this project was co-financed (pg.62 ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). In June 2018, Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agreed to extend the the loan term to 2022 (thereby increasing the maturity period to seven years) and to reduce the interest rate (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agree to extend loan term on KMG Kashagan B.V. project""). This initial loan is captured by this project.

In July 2018, Samruk-Kazyna repaid $900 million USD of the $1.5 billion USD syndicated loan early. The remaining $600 million USD was refinanced by a new syndicated loan coordinated by Japanese bank MUFG Bank, Ltd. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) participated in this syndicated loan alongside Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, JSC “Halyk Savings Bank of Kazakhstan”, and Citibank Kazakhstan. The maturity date of this loan was extended until the end of 2022 (for a maturity period of seven years) because of the postponement of the option agreement for the repurchase of shares of KMG Kashagan B.V. by KazMunayGas (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and KazMunayGaz repaid 2.5 billion U.S. loans ahead of schedule"").

"279",73476,"China National Petroleum Corporation provides $95.08 million USD for the construction of the Kazakh National Academy of Choreography","On December 4, 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a memorandum with the Kazakhstani Ministry of Education and Science for the establishment of the Kazakh National Academy of Choreography in Astana (see ""乐玉成大使出席哈萨克斯坦教育和科学部长与各国驻哈使节座谈会""). CNPC provided funds for the academy at the request of President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev as a gift for the 25th anniversary of Kazakhstan's independence (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school""). CNPC provided $95.08 million USD for the academy (pg.66 of ""2016 China National Petroleum Corporation Corporate Social Responsibility Report""). The construction of the academy had a total cost of $153 million USD; Kazakhstani-state owned National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided the remaining $58 million USD (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

Some of the funds provided by CNPC were used on the construction of the main stage of the Astana Ballet Theater, which included a 783-seat auditorium and a modern and innovative lighting system for performance. The academy consisted of a school building, an office building, a residential building, and the Astana Ballet Theater (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight""). The educational building had classrooms, a teachers’ room, an indoor garden, a cafeteria, a library, a sports hall, and other rooms. There were 21 rehearsal rooms. The residential building consisted  of dormitories and rent-free staff apartments (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school""). The academy had an area of 9.5 hectares (see ""Благотворительность"").

The academy was the first institution of higher education in Central Asia to have a full cycle of choreographic education (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography""). The academy was designated as a national institution of higher education. It had programs ranging from the basics of dance and ballet training to master’s and doctoral programs (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography Opens in Astana""). The academy taught classical ballet, traditional Kazakh dance, and modern dance. Once the students were enrolled, the Government of Kazakhstan would cover all expenses (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

Kazakhstani construction company Bazis-A was responsible for project implementation (see ""KAZAKH NATIONAL CHOREOGRAPHY ACADEMY BUILT AT EXPENSE OF EXTRA-BUDGETARY FUNDS""). Swedish company Gustafs Scandinavia AB and Russian firm Eurostroysoyuz provided materials and designs for the interior of the theatre (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography""). Construction had begun by June 2014, and the school was expected to be open in April 2016 (see ""National Academy of Choreography to Open in 2016 in EXPO Complex""). President Nazarbayev opened the academy on August 31, 2016 (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school"").

CNPC later donated ₸10 million KZT ($27,117 USD) in 2018 to help finance the academy's purchase medical rehabilitation facilities (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

"318",39562,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan for Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#40362 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030.

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”).

This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing the construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion USD. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR + a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee from the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalised interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on the information above, the interest rate was recorded as 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, or 5.108%, while the maturity period is 10 years and the grace period is zero. 

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605, while the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline is captured by linked project ID#54523.

STAFF_NOTE: As the loan financiers include a non-Chinese financier (ING Bank N.V.) and the breakdown of loan amounts between the 2 financiers are not known, a transaction amount has not been recorded for this project. This project is sometimes called “Second stage of Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline construction.""

The 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline runs from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan and runs through three regions (Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda).

"264",73384,"Bank of China provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #40362)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline  was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years).  The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). This project captures the BOC contribution; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

This 1,454 km pipeline runs through the Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.

"258",53553,"China Development Bank provides a $2 billion USD loan for the Atyrau Petrochemical Complex Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40266)","In 2009, Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries (KPI) LLP signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinopec Engineering Co., Ltd. (through Sinopec Group subsidiary China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation) for the first stage of construction of Atyrau petrochemical project (see ""哈萨克斯坦石油加工领域发展和炼厂改造情况"" and ""Sinopec to build gas chemicals plant in Kazakhstan""). On February 22, 2011, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $1.4 billion USD credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the construction of an integrated petrochemical project in the Atyrau Region of Kazakstan. However, as of 2017, no amounts had been drawn down under this credit agreement (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017""). This was due to the mutual termination of the EPC contract between KPI and Sinopec in 2014 (see ""Polypropylene plant will be built by the Chinese, but not by Sinopec Engineering""). Therefore, AidData has assumed that the China Eximbank loan was cancelled (since the proceeds of this loan were to be used to fund the EPC contract with Sinopec). For this cancelled loan, see linked project ID#40266.

Then on, December 2015, China National Chemical Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) signed a contract to construct an integrated gas-chemical complex in the Atyrau Region on a turnkey basis (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau...""). Then, on September 3, 2016, China Development Bank (Xinjiang Branch) (CDB) signed a $2 billion USD loan agreement with KPI for the construction of the complex (see ""Atyrau Petrochemical Complex""). The loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 5.8%. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided a guarantee for this loan on February 13, 2017. On November 24, 2017, CDB sent an advance payment of $409 million USD to CNCEC (see ""Technopark phase""). The project had a total cost of $2.6 billion USD; the CDB bank covered the entire cost of the $1.795 billion USD EPC contract with CNCEC; the remainder of the financing of the project was provide by its organizers of the project; KPI and its ownership (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau..."").

KPI was the project company (special purpose vehicle) responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Atyrau Petrochemical Complex Construction Project. KPI was 99% owned by United Chemical Company LLP, a subsidiary of JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna; the remaining 1% of KPI LLP was owned by a private investor, ""Firm Almex Plus” LLP (see ""About company""). Almex reportedly had a 49% ownership in November 2017, but this was either incorrect, or an indication that it sold the majority of its shares to United Chemical Company LLP (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau..."").

42 construction and installation companies were involved in the construction and installation work; 39 of which were Kazakhstani and 3 of which were foreign. The Kazakhstani companies included AtyrauNefteMash LLP, which produced the propane and propylene splitter, ""Petropavlovsk Plant of Heavy Machine Building"" JSC and Sewon-Vertex Heavy Industries received orders for the production of 35 units and heat exchangers with a total weight  (see ""Қазақстандық компаниялар мұнай-химия зауытын салуға қатысады ма""). Imstalcon JSC participated in the manufacture of equipment for the project, while the Kazakh Institute of Oil and Gas JSC participated in the design of the complex (see ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex Construction Update""). Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CB&I) received the PMC contract for project management (see ""History of the company""). The project was transferred from Samruk-Kazyna to the trust management of JSC NC KazMunayGas (KMG) in June 2018 (see ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex Construction Update"").

Upon completion, the petrochemical complex was expected to produce 500,000 tons of polypropylene per year and be the first integrated gas-chemical complex in Kazakhstan (see ""White & Case Advises Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries...""). The plant was expected to go online in 2020 (see ""中国国家开发银行与哈萨克斯坦石油化学工业公司签署阿特劳天然气化工项目第一阶段建设融资协议""). On November 27, 2017, KPI sent a notice of the start of construction work to the general contractor (see ""Technopark phase""). The message was received and work began on December 11, 2017 (see ""CB&I Gets Go-ahead for Kazakhstan Petchem Project""). In October 2020, the project was 77% complete and expected to be complete in 2021 (see ""Large petrochemical complex to be launched in western Kazakhstan in 2021"").

STAFF_NOTE: This project is sometimes referred to as ""Construction of the first integrated gas chemical complex in Atyrau oblast,"" ""Construction of an integrated gas chemical complex in the Atyrau region - the first phase (polypropylene), or ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex (Phase I – polypropylene production).""

SEG was the leader of the consortium; Marubeni Corporation participated in the logistics and procurement, as well as organizing financing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, while JSC OGCC KazStroyService participated in construction and local procurement under SEG's leadership (see ""Implementation of the project 'Construction of a deep oil refining complex'"").

Then, on June 6, 2012, Atyrau Refinery LLP entered into a $1,130,408,642 USD buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (#BLA201201) with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by this project (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The BCL bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 4.1% per annum and matures on November 6, 2025 (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus""). China Export & Credit Insurance Corporation (Sinosure) provided $1.7 billion USD of buyer’s credit insurance (covering the loan loan principal and interest). The BCL received an official guarantee from the Government of Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Finance (see slide 161 of ""Brief Summary/Kesimpulan Singkat Working Group on Oil, Gas and Coal""). JSC NC “KazMunayGas” also provided a guarantee for the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.1 million USD (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on October 15, 2012, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by linked project ID#54798. The PBC's maturity date was October 15, 2025, and it carried an interest rate of 3% per annum. This loan agreement was amended on October 30, 2014; however, the terms of the revision are unknown. Nor is it clear if DBK on-lent the proceeds of the PBC loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the PBC loan was $179.5 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

The total cost of the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project was $1,679,892,000.52 USD. It was also financed by a $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01) from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, a $297,500,000 USD loan dated August 8, 2012 from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and three loans dated July 27, 2012, November 13, 2012, and December 29, 2012 that collectively amounted to ₸20,790,000 KZT from JSC KazMunayGaz - Refining and Marketing. The loans also covered commissions for arranging loans and insurance premiums (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The loans from Eximbank, JBIC (which may have involved the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.), and DBK were all guaranteed by JSC NC “KazMunayGas” (see pg.108-109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Sinopec subsidiary Sinopec Luoyang Engineering Co., Ltd. was involved in the implementation of the project (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙""). Atyrau Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Kazakhstan and in 2011 refined 100,000 bbl of crude oil every day (see ""Awarded Contract for Atyrau Refinery Modernization Project Phase 3 in Kazakhstan"").

The project sought to increase the productivity of Atyrau Refinery to 5.5 million tons per year and oil refining efficiency to 87%, gaining the yield of motor fuel up to 77%, corresponding to the international standards of Euro-4 and Euro-5 (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP""). The project included the construction of 12 individual process units, a main facility with a catalytic cracking unit, designed for the conversion by delayed coking of the atmospheric distillation residues, heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil and heavy gas oil into liquified petroleum gas, gasoline, and light cracking gas oil. The complex was set to include LPG desulfurization facilities, oligomerization, a naphtha hydro-treating unit, a gasoline and gas oil catalytic cracking unit, hydrogen production, isomerization units, etc. (see ""Atyrau refinery LLP (AR)"").

The project's groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 10, 2012 (see ""哈萨克斯坦2012年石油工业发展简况""). It was expected that the implementation period would be 41 months (41 months from the groundbreaking ceremony is February 2016) and that construction would be completed in 2016 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The turnkey project was formally handed over to the project owner on May 30, 2019 (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙"""").

STAFF_NOTE: The average 6-month LIBOR in June 2012 was 0.736%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 0.736% + 4.1%, or 4.836%. The Chinese name of this project is 哈萨克斯坦阿特劳炼油厂石油项目. AidData suspects that the PBC captured by project ID#54798 partially financed DBK's earlier $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01); while the PBC came two months after this loan, DBK may have made that loan knowing that China Eximbank planned to contribute. If this is the case, it would explain how the project cost was reported as $1,679,892,000.52 USD despite the existence of this loan, which would have otherwise substantially increased the amount of financing. However, as stated earlier, it is unclear if this PBC was used to on-lend by DBK; this is merely informed speculation.

The $1.13 billion USD China Eximbank BCL to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project is separate from the $884 million USD China Eximbank loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project (see project ID#54066). It is very likely that the KazMunayGas Atyrau Oil Refinery Construction Project was funded through the $3.5 billion USD restricted portion of a China Eximbank Master Loan Facility (MLF) to the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, as captured in project ID#54797.

The restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. The proceeds from this credit facility were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstan companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China (see pg.57-58 of ""DBK 2010 Base Prospectus"").

Under the restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA (as captured by linked project ID#54797), DBK entered into a $884 million USD individual credit agreement with China Eximbank on December 12, 2009. The maturity date of this individual credit agreement was July 21, 2023. Principal and interest under the agreement was to be paid semi-annually (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

DBK then used these loan proceeds to on-lend to Atyrau Refinery LLP (a project company and special purpose vehicle responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery) as part of a larger $1.63 billion USD loan agreement. This loan agreement with Atyrau Refinery LLP, which is a subsidiary of KazMunayGas, was divided into a $691.4 million USD tranche with an interest rate rate an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin, a $40.4 million USD tranche with an interest rate of 7.72% per annum (payable in KZT), and a ₸58.536 million KZT tranche with an interest rate of 10.99% per annum (payable in KZT). DBK also offered a ₸26.401 million KZT credit line for the project, while Atyrau Refinery LLP contributed $66.63 million USD (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP"").

The purpose of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project was to construct an aromatic hydrocarbons complex at the Atyrau Refinery capable of producing benzol and paraxylene. It also sought to increase the plant's balanced capacity to 5 million tons per year and produce motor fuels that meet K3 environmental requirements. Sinopec Engineering was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. JSC OGCC KazStroyService served as its subcontractor, while KazMunayGas was also a participant (see pg.16-17 of ""Annual report of “KazMunayGas – Refinery and Marketing” Joint-Stock Company for 2014""). Construction was set to begin in January 2010 (see ""Kazakhstan industry: China's Sinopec to finance hydrocarbons plant""). However, the construction of the complex began in October 2010 (see ""Implementation of the project...""). It was completed on December 25, 2014 (see ""The ceremony of the beginning of commissioning at a complex for production of aromatic hydrocarbons"").

STAFF_NOTE: The DBK credit agreement with China Eximbank was revised three times (on December 19, 2013, May 8, 2014 and October 30, 2014); however, the terms of these revisions are unknown (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017""). Also,China Eximbank provided a separate $1,130,408,642 USD buyer’s credit loan in 2012 to Atyrau Refinery LLP for a Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Project at the Atyrau Refinery (see project ID#39556).

This aromatic hydrocarbons complex is located in Atyrau.

"262",54798,"China Eximbank provides a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit for the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project (Linked to Project ID#39556 and #54797))","On December 29, 2011, Atyrau Refinery LLP  — a project company and subsidiary of Kazakh state-owned KazMunayGas — signed an EPC turnkey contract for the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project (also known as the Advanced Oil Refining Complex Construction Project and the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project) with a consortium of contractors consisting of Sinopec Engineering Group (SEG), Marubeni Corporation, and JSC OGCC KazStroyService. SEG was the leader of the consortium; Marubeni Corporation participated in the logistics and procurement, as well as organizing financing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, while JSC OGCC KazStroyService participated in construction and local procurement under SEG's leadership (see ""Implementation of the project ""Construction of a deep oil refining complex"").

Then, on June 6, 2012, Atyrau Refinery LLP entered into a $1,130,408,642 USD buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (#BLA201201) with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by linked project ID#39556 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The BCL bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 4.1% per annum and matures on November 6, 2025 (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus""). Sinosure provided $1.7 billion USD of buyer’s credit insurance (covering the loan loan principal and interest). The BCL received an official guarantee from the Government of Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Finance (see slide 161 of ""Brief Summary/Kesimpulan Singkat Working Group on Oil, Gas and Coal""). JSC NC “KazMunayGas” also provided a guarantee for the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.1 million USD (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on October 15, 2012, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by this project. The loan's maturity date was October 15, 2025, and it carried an interest rate of 3% per annum. This loan agreement was amended on October 30, 2014; however, the terms of the revision are unknown. Nor is it clear if DBK on-lent the proceeds of the PBC loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the PBC loan was $179.5 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

The total cost of the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project was $1,679,892,000.52 USD. It was also financed by a $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01) from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, a $297,500,000 USD loan dated August 8, 2012 from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and three loans dated July 27, 2012, November 13, 2012, and December 29, 2012 that collectively amounted to ₸20,790,000 KZT from JSC KazMunayGaz - Refining and Marketing. The loans also covered commissions for arranging loans and insurance premiums (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The loans from Eximbank, JBIC (which may have involved the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.), and DBK were all guaranteed by JSC NC “KazMunayGas” (see pg.108-109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Sinopec subsidiary Sinopec Luoyang Engineering Co., Ltd. was involved in the implementation of the project (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙""). Atyrau Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Kazakhstan and in 2011 refined 100,000 bbl of crude oil every day (see ""Awarded Contract for Atyrau Refinery Modernization Project Phase 3 in Kazakhstan""). 

The project sought to increase the productivity of Atyrau Refinery to 5.5 million tons per year and oil refining efficiency to 87%, gaining the yield of motor fuel up to 77%, corresponding to the international standards of Euro-4 and Euro-5 (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP""). The project included the construction of 12 individual process units, a main facility with a catalytic cracking unit, designed for the conversion by delayed coking of the atmospheric distillation residues, heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil and heavy gas oil into liquified petroleum gas, gasoline, and light cracking gas oil. The complex was set to include LPG desulfurization facilities, oligomerization, a naphtha hydro-treating unit, a gasoline and gas oil catalytic cracking unit, hydrogen production, isomerization units, etc. (see ""Atyrau refinery LLP (AR)"").

The project's groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 10, 2012 (see ""哈萨克斯坦2012年石油工业发展简况""). It was expected that the implementation period would be 41 months (41 months from the groundbreaking ceremony being February 2016) and that construction would be completed in 2016 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The turnkey project was formally handed over to the project owner on May 30, 2019 (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of this project is 哈萨克斯坦阿特劳炼油厂石油项目. AidData suspects that the PBC captured by this project partially financed DBK's earlier $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01); while the PBC came two months after this loan, DBK may have made that loan knowing China Eximbank planned to contribute. If this is the case, it would explain how the project cost was reported as $1,679,892,000.52 USD despite the existence of this loan, which would have otherwise substantially increased the amount of financing. However, as stated earlier, it is unclear if this PBC was used to on-lend by DBK; this is merely AidData's informed speculation.

The $1.13 billion USD China Eximbank BCL to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project is separate from the $884 million USD China Eximbank loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project (see project ID#54066). It is very likely that the KazMunayGas Atyrau Oil Refinery Construction Project was funded through the $3 billion USD restricted portion of a China Eximbank Master Loan Facility (MLF) to the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, as captured in project ID#54797.

The oil refining complex was located in Atyrau.

DBK then used these loan proceeds to on-lend to KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP (a project company and special purpose vehicle responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Sulphide Ore Processing Plant Project at the Aktogay Mine). This loan agreement with AKAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP carried the following terms: a maturity period of 8.5 years and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + 4.50% (see ""KAZ Minerals: Credit line approval""). DBK additionally provided $600 million USD for the project, while KAZ Minerals added $963 million USD. The plant was expected to have a capacity of 25 million tons annually (see ""Information on KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP""). In 2014, China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was granted the contract to construct the sulphide concentrator (see ""Chinese Projects Bring New Opportunities to Aktogay in Kazakhstan""). The main sulphide concentrator was commissioned on December 6, 2016 (see ""NEW $300 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF KAZAKHSTAN AND PXF UPDATE""). Production began in February 2017 (see ""Completion of Koksay Project Investment By NFC"").

STAFF_NOTE: Because the exact date of signing of the CDB-DBK deal was unknown, the average 6-month LIBOR for the year 2016 was used instead, 1.058%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 1.058% + 4.5%, or 5.558%. This loan is linked to two previous loans for the Aktogay Mine (Kazakh: Ақтоғай мыс кен орны), a large scale, open pit mine with an average copper grade of 0.36% (oxide) and 0.33% (sulphide). In 2011, CDB committed two loans (see Project ID#41941 and #39557) worth $1.5 billion USD: a $1.34 billion USD and an RMB 1 billion loan to develop the Aktogay mine for copper cathode production.

On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

The loan carried a maturity period of seven years, and JV Caspi Bitum LLP pledged the plant as a guarantee for the loan. JV Caspi Bitum LLP was a project company (special purpose vehicle) that established in October 2009 to assume responsible for the financing, design, and implementation of the Bitumen Asphalt Plant Construction Project. Its owners were Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries JSC (KPI) (50%), a subsidiary of KazMunay Gas, and CITIC Kazakhstan LLP (50%), a subsidiary of CITIC Group (see ""НЕФТЬ""). The proceeds of the BOC loan were meant to cover 80% of the cost of the bitumen (asphalt) plant (see ""National Company KazMunayGas (Kazakhstan) informed about signing Loan Agreement..."").

For CITIC Kazakhstan's contribution, see linked project ID#73404.

This bitumen asphalt plant was located in the city of Aktau, at the former Aktau Plastics Plant in the Mangystau Region. The project sought to construct a plant enable to produce high quality road bitumen in order to satisfy the Kazakhstan's requirements for road construction. The plant was expected to produce 406,500 tons of road bitumen, 225,400 tons of petrol-diesel fraction, and 330,300 tons of vacuum gas oil per year (see pg.35 of ""KMG Annual Report 2011""). The plant was planned to use up to 1 million tons of oil per year from the Mangystau Karazhanbas as feedstock. The plant was also intended to reduce Kazakhstan's reliance on Russian bitumen imports (see ""НЕФТЬ""). JSC OGCC KazStroyService and CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. were contractors responsible for project implementation (see ""Bank of China to provide $232 ml loan to finance construction of an asphalt plant in Aktau"")

Work on the project was expected to be completed in December 2012 (see pg.35 of ""KMG Annual Report 2011"").

"263",73384,"Bank of China provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #40362)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline  was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years).  The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). This project captures the BOC contribution; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

This 1,454 km pipeline runs through the Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.

"290",61056,"CDB provides $2.3 billion USD in debt facilities for the development of Bozshakol and Bozymchak copper deposits - Drawn Down Amount (Linked to Project ID#40241 and #61142)","In December 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC secured debt facilities worth $2.7 billion USD by a loan from China Development Bank (CDB) and JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna for the development of copper deposits Bozshakol, Bozymchak and other growth projects. The breakdown of these debt facilities was as follows: $2.1 billion USD signed on December 30, 2009 for Bozshakol, Bozymchak, and other development projects; $200 million USD signed on January 12, 2010 for Bozshakol, Bozymchak, and other development projects; two facilities of $200 million USD each for the Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects signed on June 11, 2012. KAZ Minerals and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, provided a guarantee for these obligations. The funds were fully drawn in January 2013. They attracted interest semi-annually at an annualized rate of USD LIBOR + a 4.80% margin. The loans under this credit line had a final maturity date falling between January 2022 and August 2025. The first repayment commenced in January 2013. The $400 million USD that had been allocated to Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects was repaid early, in January 2014, because these projects were unlikely to proceed in the medium term (see pg.53 and 96 of ""RELEASE OF FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 AND RESUMPTION OF TRADING"").

For the remaining $2.3 billion USD, KAZ Minerals signed an amendment to the debt facilities with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna on December 29, 2014. The changes made by the amendment include the following: the facilities became bilateral between KAZ Minerals and CDB; the interest rate was lowered from USD LIBOR + a 4.80% margin to USD LIBOR + a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed to, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The loan’s maturity and grace period were left unchanged; KAZ Minerals PLC continued to guarantee this CDB facility (pg.135 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016"" and ""Amendment to CDB facilities""). The amount outstanding on the previous facility when the amendment was signed was $2.1 billion USD. As of December 31, 2016, $1.7 billion had been drawn down under the facility agreements. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost of $20 million USD were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39 (pg.135 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016"").

To calculate the interest rate at time of commitment, the 6-month LIBOR rate as of December 2009 was used (0.453%); total interest rate equals 0.453% + 4.8%, or 5.253%. The grace period was set to 3 years (as the loan was first contracted on December 30, 2009 and the first repayment began in January 2013), and the maturity period was set to 15.66 years (as the loan was contracted on December 30, 2009 and the final loan maturity date was in August 2025). The bilateral amendment between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified the loan proceeds were to be used “principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects."" As of November 30, 2014, the principal balance outstanding on the facilities was $2.086 billion USD. This project records the transaction amount $2.3 billion USD, as it appears to have been fully drawn down (see ""Amendment to CDB facilities"").

Bozymchak is an open-pit copper mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region of the Jalal-Abad Region, Kyrgyzstan. China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was the EPC contractor for the Bozymchak mine project (see ""NFC In Central Asia""). The completion ceremony for the Bozymchak mine took place on August 5, 2015 (see ""Kazakhmys Gold opens new copper, gold and silver mine in Kyrgyzstan""). Detailed locational information about this mine can be found at https://www.mindat.org/loc-297492.html.

The Bozshakol mine is a large copper mine located in the North Kazakhstan Region. NFC was the EPC contractor for the Bozshakol mine project, with a contract valued at $486 million USD. The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tonnes per year. It was planned to be complete on June 30, 2015. (see ""NFC Signs Contract on Bozshakol Copper Concentrator Project with Kazakhmys"").

"292",53544,"China Development Bank provides a $400 million USD loan for the 630 MW Third Unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#66481)","On October 22, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and Russia's Vnesheconombank (VEB) signed a $400 million USD loan agreement to finance the construction of the Third Unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan (see ""Eighteenth regular meeting between the heads of the Russian and Chinese governments""). The loan had a maturity period of 10 years; its other terms are unknown. This loan was often lumped together with a $800 million USD CDB loan to VEB for a multifunctional complex in Moscow, signed at the same time (captured by linked project ID#66481), as a ""$1.2 billion USD loan"" (see pg.50 of ""VEB Annual Report 2013""). 

VEB used the proceeds of the CDB $400 million USD loan to on-lend to the ""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC) for the construction of the third unit of Ekibastuz GRES-2 coal power plant in Ekibastuz. Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу""). VEB led a consortium, that included the Eurasian Bank of Kazakhstan, were to provide a $700 million USD syndicated loan for the project (see ""DEWEY & LEBOEUF REPRESENTS EKIBASTUZ GRES-2 POWER STATION ON A $770 MILLION SECURED FINANCING""). The project had a total cost of $700 million USD (see ""China and Russia to spend $400 million on Kazakhstan power plant""). VEB's finances were drained because of its financing of Olympic facilities in Sochi, making it look to CDB to partially finance the project (see ""Taming the Dragon: How Can Russia Benefit From China’s Financial Ambitions in the SCO?"").

""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC), an energy company located in Kazakhstan, managed the plant. Until December 2019, Russian energy company Inter RAO UES owned 50% and Samruk-Energy (JSC) owned 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-2. In December 2919, Samruk-Kazyna JSC purchased the 50% Inter RAO's shares for $25 million USD, transferring the plant entirely to Kazakhstan through the management of Samruk-Energy (JSC). Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу"").

The two existing power units at GRES-2 currently produce about 12% of all electricity produced in Kazakhstan in 2010. The CDB-financed project involved the construction, development and operation of a third unit, which, once completed, would seek to increase the power station’s installed capacity by 50% (see ""DEWEY & LEBOEUF REPRESENTS EKIBASTUZ GRES-2 POWER STATION ON A $770 MILLION SECURED FINANCING""). The capacity of the third unit was expected to be 630 MW. Construction began on October 21, 2014. The project was planned to be completed in 2017 (see ""На Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 началось строительство 3-го энергоблока"").  Construction was apparently delayed in 2016, but it has since returned (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу"").

The loan accrued the following terms: a maturity period of 15 years (the maturity date was May 21, 2025) and an interest rate of 4%. The principal and interest were to be repaid semiannually. As of June 30, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under this loan was $324 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"" and “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC”). Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) provided a guarantee for the loan, which was reportedly a line of credit (see “Overview of key developments from analysts of Asyl Invest JSC (Kazakhstan) on April 16, 2010”).
 
DBK then used the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan to on-lend to Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter JSC (KAS) (also known as Kazakhstan Electrolytic Plant JSC), the project company and a subsidiary of ENRC and responsible for the Pavlodar Aluminium Smelter Construction Project. The entire project cost $1.0183 billion USD, and KAS contributed $618.3 million USD (see pg.67 of “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC” and ""Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter JSC"").

The Pavlodar Aluminium Smelter project sought to construct a primary aluminum smelter in Pavlodar with a capacity of 250,000 tons per year (see “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC”). In addition to financing the smelter, the loan was intended to pay for costs incurred during the first and second phases of the electrolysis plant (see “Overview of key developments from analysts of Asyl Invest JSC (Kazakhstan) on April 16, 2010”). China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was the EPC contractor. Construction began in 2014 (see “President of Kazakhstan Inspects CPC Plant Undertaken by NFC in Pavlodar”). The project was accepted as complete on December 11, 2015 (see ""Two Projects Undertaken by NFC Passed Kazakhstan National Unified Acceptance"").

The Pavlodar aluminium smelter site was located to the south-east of the Pavlodar residential zone: 13.5 km away from its boundary and 10 km away from the operating alumina refinery and from the heat power plant of the JSC Aluminium of Kazakhstan (see pg.4 of “COMPOSITION OF THE PROJECT.”).

This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing the construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion USD. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR + a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee from the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalised interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on the information above, the interest rate was recorded as 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, or 5.108%, while the maturity period is 10 years and the grace period is zero. 

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605, while the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline is captured by linked project ID#54523.

The 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline runs from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan and runs through three regions (Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda). A 483 km segment runs from the Kenkiyak station to the Aralsk area, and a 311 km segment to the Kumkol station.

This project is linked to a $8.7 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in September 2009 for this project (see linked project ID#70878), a $4.9 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in February 2011 for this project (see linked project ID#70881),  a $4 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in June 2011 (see linked project ID#70884), and a $2 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in September 2012 (see linked project ID#70886).

STAFF_NOTE: The 6 month LIBOR in 2012 was .582%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as .582% + 2.5%, or 3.082%.

This project is linked to a $8.7 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in September 2009 for this project (see linked project ID#70878), a $4.9 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in February 2011 for this project (see linked project ID#70881), a $4 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in June 2011 (see linked project ID#70884), and a $2.2 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in October 2012 (see linked project ID#70889).

STAFF_NOTE: The 6 month LIBOR in 2012 was .672%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as .672% + 2.5%, or 3.172%.

The agreement included an extradition clause as well as a Chinese pledge to expand infrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic.

To facilitate such projects, China granted the Kyrgyz Republic 60 million RMB.

On March 13, 2007, China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd., and Kyrgyzstan Minister of Transport and Communications Suleymanov signed the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Highway construction contract.

The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.25% commitment fee, and 0.18% management fee.  

The proceeds from this loan were to be used to finance a commercial contract (number D-166-21/322) between the Joint Stock Company (JSC) “Electric Power Plants of Kyrgyzstan” and Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA). This project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.  The project began implementation on April 26, 2014 and it was successfully completed on August 30, 2017. 

However, this project was plagued by controversy. The project was completed and put into production at the end of August 2017, but major failures occurred within less than 5 months of operation, and some boilers collapsed, causing power outages and stopping heating. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that “I’ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.” Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country’s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project. Prosecutors in the case claimed that rigged bidding and inflated pricing would cost the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as much as $111,252,797.

"437",71092,"China Eximbank provides RMB 100 million loan for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Factory Project (Linked to project ID#40305)","On April 12, 2001, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a Governmental Concessional Loan Agreement (GCL) with the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic (see ""The Supplemental agreement on the Government concessional loan agreement on the paper mill project (July 11, 2003)""). In the loan, China Eximbank agreed to loan the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic RMB 100 million for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Factory Project. This loan carried the following terms: an interest rate of 3% and a maturity period of 15 years (see slide 16 of JICA's ""China’s Foreign Aid: Current Status and Future Challenges"").

The paper mill itself was the product of a joint Sino-Kyrgyz venture. The plans for the paper mill began in the 1990s with agreements between China and Kyrgyzstan. Construction reportedly began in August 2000 (see pg.18, 27 of ""China as an Emerging Donor in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan""). It was completed at the end of August 2002. After it went into production, it experienced a series of disturbances, investigations, and inspections, to the detriment of normal operations. The factory, located in Tokmok, went bankrupt within three years. There had been serious financial wrongdoings and violations of the migration regime by the plant's Chinese employees.

This loan was first restructured in 2003. This refinancing is recorded in Project ID#40305. The maturity date (June 6, 2017) and the interest rate (3%) were left unchanged, but the lender China Eximbank waived the requirement that the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic make principal and interest repayments until September 20, 2007. This amendment effectively represented the provision of a grace period of 4.25 years (see ""The Supplemental agreement on the Government concessional loan agreement on the paper mill project (July 11, 2003)""). 

In December 2014, this second-time refinancing for the loan was under discussion. Kyrgyzstan announced that it owed a debt of approximately 9.8 million U.S. dollars to the Export-Import Bank of China on the construction project of the paper factory. Prior to the second restructuring, the Kyrgyz authorities had repeatedly requested that China Eximbank convert the loan into a grant (i.e. write off their oustanding debt obligations for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Mill Project), but China Eximbank declined. Both sides agreed to reschedule the loan a second time and signed another amendment to the loan agreement to codify the terms of the second rescheduling. 

On March 16, 2015, Kyrgyzstan announced that the paper factory has gone through bankruptcy procedures and is evaluating its assets to sell for debt repayment. According to the results of negotiations between the Ministry of Finance of Kyrgyzstan and China at the end of 2014, the debt of RMB 60.2 million will be repaid in five installments before June 20, 2017, with an annual interest rate of 2% during the period.

This project has been plagued by controversy.

The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.

According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site. 

Staff Note: The Alternative North-South Road Project (Russian: строительства альтернативной дороги Север—Юг; Chinese: “北-南公路”) is being implemented in three parts and financed with 3 different China Eximbank loans: Phase 1 of the project [Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486)] is being financed with a $399,989,041 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID# 40491). Phase 2 of the project [the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km)] is being financed with a RMB 697,562,608.76 government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank (Project ID#46350) and a 185,254,119 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID#53585). Phase 3 of the project [the Balykchy-Kyzyl-Zhyldyz Section (0-183km) was funded by the Asian Development Bank. Since Project ID#40491 is an export buyer’s credit provided on concessional terms, it is coded as having mixed intent.","","ADM2",76.71,42.03,"Ton","District","KGZ.9.3_1","Kyrgyzstan"

"1272",49343,"China Eximbank provides RMB 700 million government concessional loan for Supply of 13 Diesel Multiple Units for Sri Lanka Railways Project","In 2010, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 700 million government concessional loan (GCL) agreement [CS-DRMS Report 814 notes it as ID#1290003032010110253] for the Supply of 13 Diesel Multiple Units for Sri Lanka Railways Project. The GCL carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 5 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.5% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. 
This first disbursement through this loan took place in 2010 and the last disbursement took place in 2014. The purpose of the project was to facilitate the procurement of thirteen, Class S12 Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) for Sri Lanka Railways, and thereby strengthen the passenger transport service of Sri Lanka Railways by adding 13 DMUs to its fleet of rolling stock. Seven of the S12 DMUs were ordered to strengthen long-distance travel on the Main Line from Colombo to Badulla. The steep slopes on the up-country portion of the Main Line make it difficult to operate. 
 Prior to the S12 DMUs, only a few models of locomotives were capable of operating this line. Four of the S12 DMUs were ordered to serve the Kelani Valley Line. Two of the S12 DMUs were ordered to be used for tourist transportation. The thirteen S12 DMUs were scheduled for delivery in four batch by September 2012. CRRC Sifang — a wholly-owned subsidiary of China South Locomotive and Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation — was the contractor responsible for delivery of the DMUs. 
The first batch of DMUs arrived in Sri Lanka in August 2012. The first Main Line train using a S12 DMU began on October 23, 2012. This project is now complete, but the exact dates of delivery of the second, third, and fourth batches are unknown.
This project facilitated the acquisition of Diesel Multiple Units for use on the Main (Railway) Line from Colombo to Badulla and the Kelani Valley Line. The Main Line starts from Colombo and runs east and north past the rapidly developing centres of Ragama, Gampaha, Veyangoda, and Polgahawela. At Rambukkana, the Main Line begins its steep climb into the hills of the upcountry. Between Balana and Kadugannawa, the track clings to the side of sheer cliffs, offering passengers views of Batalegala ('Bible' Rock). From Peradeniya Junction, a branch line reaches Kandy and Matale. The Main Line then continues its climb through tea country, connecting local market centres at Gampola, Nawalapitiya, and Hatton before reaching Nanu Oya. The Main Line continues its ascent to the summit at Pattipola, 1,898 m (6,227 ft) above sea level, before descending past Bandarawela to Badulla. The Kelani Valley line runs southeast from Colombo Maradana Station, through much of the city of Colombo. It runs through major business centres, like Nugegoda and Maharagama, before turning eastwards. It crosses the Southern Expressway near Homagama and continues east towards Avissawella, the current terminus of the line. Major railway stations on the line are Colombo Fort, Maradana, Narahenpita, Nugegoda, Maharagama, Pannipitiya, Kottawa, Homagama, Meegoda, Padukka, Waga, Kosgama, and Avissawella.
 STAFF_NOTE: The DMUs are sometimes referred to as “power sets”. China Eximbank provided a separate loan in 2007 to facilitate the procurement of 15 Diesel Multiple Units (see Project ID #33260).","https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/embed?mid=1MWgzBW7Lpk_TT8gNhq1qCmYzeBg&ll=7.1641716380454294%2C80.38554466042416&z=10","ADM0",NA,NA,"Sri Lanka","Country","LKA","Sri Lanka"

This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway.

This project involves the construction of a scientific research complex, a water quality analysis platform, a pilot study center, expert accommodations, and supporting facilities. 
The purpose of the project, which is taking place in Kandy (Sri Lanka’s second largest city) is to find a scientific solution to end chronic kidney disease of unknown origin (CKD). Chronic kidney disease (CKD) has spread over 11 districts in Sri Lanka mainly due to the changes in various human activities and environmental factors. Over the past 30 years, it has become a major health issue. This disease is particularly acute among the farmers’ 40-60 age groups. Most researchers believe that the cause of CKD is drinking contaminated water. China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group Co., Ltd. (CTCE) — a subsidiary of China Railway Group Ltd. — is the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 28, 2018. Then, on July 17, 2009, the project successfully passed mid-term acceptance with the funder of the project (the Chinese Government’s Ministry of Commerce). The originally anticipated project completion date was May 2020.

"1093",53528,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.636 billion government concessional loan for Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project","On December 22, 2017, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed an RMB 1,636,600,000 government concessional loan (GCL) agreement for the Kandy North Pathadumbara Integrated Water Supply Project. This loan will cover the full cost of the project, and it carries an interest rate of 2%, a maturity of 20 years, and a 6 year grace period (see Sri Lanka Department of External Resources 2017 Annual Performance Report). 
 The objective of this project is to provide safe pipe-borne water supply facility to six divisions, namely Pathadumbara, Harispattuwa, Akurana, Pujapitiya, Kandy Four Gravets and Thumpane. The scope of this project includes the construction of a clear water reservoir (2100m3 within existing water treatment plant), a filtration unit, a flocculation unit, a new pump station and improvements to existing stations, Slude lagoon, service reservoirs, and pump houses. The project also includes the improvement of existing pump stations and the supply and laying of distribution lines and transmission lines. The project is distributed in 6 administrative areas in the north of Kandy. The construction area is about 318 square kilometers. The main construction content is the laying of 83 kilometers of water supply pipelines, 567 kilometers of water distribution pipelines, 29 pools and 18 pumping stations. After all the planning of the project is completed, it is expected to meet the domestic water demand of 470,000 people.
 PowerChina is the contractor responsible for project implementation. As of September 30, 2018 this project had only achieved a “physical progress” rate of 4%. The loan agreement had already been finalized at that time, but cabinet approval was needed for deviations in the project scope. Land acquisition and procurement activities were underway. Then, on September 21, 2019, a groundbreaking ceremony took place. The expected completion date of the project is 2021.

The interest rate comes out to be 6.709%, since the LIBOR 6-month rate was 0.409% and the margin was 6.3%. Sinosure provided insurance for the loan. 
 The total cost of the 35 MW Broadlands Hydropower Project was $82 million. ICBC covered 85% of the cost, and Hatton National Bank of Sri Lanka covered the remaining 15%. The project involved the construction of 35 MW run-of-the-river hydroelectric complex over the Kelani River in Kitulgala. More specifically, it involved the construction of a 24m high & 144m long main dam, a 19m high & 48m long diversion dam, a 2.7m diameter & 850m long diversion tunnel, a 5.4m diameter & 3 km long main tunnel, a 35MW surface power station (2 units of 17.5MW), a switch yard, and a 4 km long transmission line. The complex has an installed capacity of 35 MW and is expected to generate 126 GWh of electrical energy annually. 
 The contractor responsible for implementation was China National Electric Equipment Corporation. Its work was supervised by Ceylon Electricity Board, the largest electricity company in Sri Lanka. Construction began on July 17, 2013. River closure took place on November 20, 2016. On June 6, 2019, a breakthrough ceremony of the main headrace tunnel took place. Project implementation was still underway in late 2019.

The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.
The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

The interest rate of the CDB loan that supported this project is coded based on the 6-month LIBOR at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in June 2012 was 0.736%. The interest rate was therefore coded as 0.736% + 2.90%, or 3.636%.
The purpose of the project, which is also known as the Construction of Head Work of Moragahakanda Reservoir Project and the ""Three Gorges Project in Sri Lanka,"" was to provide water for irrigation purposes for those living in northern region of Sri Lanka. Another goal of the project was to supply drinking water to millions of local people. It is also expected to generate 20 megawatts of power, addressing a long-term need for domestic and industrial electricity demand in the north-central, northern and eastern provinces. 
To achieve these goals, a 61m high and 465m long dam was constructed and reservoir was impounded. Upon completion, it was expected that the Moragahakanda reservoir would hold 570 million cubic metres (MCM) of water covering an extent of 2,950 hectares. The intended beneficiaries of this project are people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts. 
Sinohydro was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on January 25, 2012. A groundbreaking ceremony took place in February 2013. On May 31, 2017 the four units of the Moragahakanda Dam completed debugging ahead of grid connection. Reservoir impoundment took place on January 11, 2017. An official project completion ceremony was organized on January 8, 2018. 
The Moragahakanda dam is located across the Amban River at Elahera, in the Matale District of Sri Lanka. Its locational coordinates are 07°41′56″N 80°46′12″E. The intended beneficiaries of the Moragahakanda Development Project, which included the construction of the dam and other activities, were people living in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Mathale, and Trincomalee districts.

 The head works of the project include the dam, a spillway with seven radial gates (10m x 7.2m), water intake, headrace tunnel, surge shaft, penstock, power house and new access roads. In addition to the head works the project will also involve construction of structures such as camp sites, site offices, storage areas, vehicle parks etc which can use later for community purposes. The project commencement date was December 22, 2017.","http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/m/powerchina/2018-11/13/content_37258459.htm","ADM2",81.09,6.99,"Badulla","Division","LKA.3.1_1","Sri Lanka"

On this same day, China Development Bank signed an 805 million USD commercial loan financing agreement with CCC for this project (see attached 2014 article CDB). The 805 million USD loan from China Development Bank for the Colombo Port City Project is captured in this project. For details regarding the equity investment from CCC, see linked project ID #55528. 
The Colombo Port City (CPC) Project was initially conceived as a public sector project that would be undertaken by the Sri Lanka Port Authority (SLPA). Consequently, the SLPA commissioned at its own cost an “initial technical feasibility study” in April 2010 for the reclamation of land south of the new breakwater. Around June 2010, an environmental impact assessment study was commissioned by SLPA also at its own cost through the University of Moratuwa (UoM) for a reclamation area of 200 hectares. 
In October 2010, Sri Lanka’s Urban Development Authority (UDA) completed a master plan study based on the initial technical feasibility study and submitted a project proposal to the SLPA for consideration. In April 2011, based on an unsolicited concept proposal submitted by China Communications & Construction Company (CCCC), the parent company of CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) decided to not to commit public funds to construct the CPC Project and proceeded to negotiate with CCCC to implement the project entirely as a foreign direct investment, with no financial guarantees by the GOSL on the investment. 
After a 2.5 year period of negotiation with a Standing Cabinet Appointed Review Committee (SCARC) and a Technical Evaluation Committee (TEC) represented by 16 GOSL organizations, a project agreement was entered into between CHEC Port City Colombo (PVT) Ltd., and the Secretary to the Ministry of Highways, Ports and Shipping (acting for and on behalf of the GOSL) on September 16, 2014. CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd., is a project company (special purpose vehicle) and wholly owned subsidiary of China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC), which operates under its parent company China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC). 
The project agreement was signed, and the project’s construction works were ceremonially inaugurated on the same day (September 16, 2014) in the presence of the President of the Peoples’ Republic of China and the President of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, during the Chinese President’s State visit to Sri Lanka. Colombo Port City (CPC) Project is being implemented on public-private partnership (PPP) project and BOOT basis and it is being financed according to a 70:30 debt-to-equity ratio. 
The $1.396 billion project is divided into two phases: the first phase investment will cost $1.150 billion and the second phase investment will cost $246 million. The first phase was started on September 16, 2014. Its originally planned completion date was April 2020, but construction was suspended due to the change of government in March 2015. Construction then resumed in August 2016. The new expected completion date is April 2024. 
On May 12, 2017, China Development Bank provided a $805 million loan to CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt.) Ltd. for the first phase of the project, or roughly 70% of the total cost of the first phase project of the project. The loan carries a 10-year maturity and a 3-year grace period. No sovereign guarantee was provided for the loan. China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) is the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation.

This loan carried a 2% interest rate. 
 The Ministry of Finance of the Government of Sri Lanka then used the proceeds from this China Eximbank loan to on-lend at a 10% interest rate to Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), which is a state-owned electricity company that controls all major functions of electricity generation, transmission, distribution and retailing in Sri Lanka. This project involved the construction of two diesel storage tanks of 10,000 MT each at the Kelanithissa Power Station. This project started on September 23, 2004. It was completed on October 31, 2005. The implementing agency is China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation (中国寰球工程公司).
 The Kelanitissa Power Station, which was commissioned in 2003, is located on the south bank of the Kelani River in the northern part of the city of Colombo, Sri Lanka. Its exact coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/40490 and https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kelanitissa+Power+Station/@6.9526629,79.8785059,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x478dd69521e70eb1?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwid0v3n2c_pAhUFoHIEHePIAmgQ_BIwDXoECBcQCw.
 STAFF_NOTE: This project is sometimes referred to as the Kelanitissa Diesel Storage Tank Project. Some sources refer to the face value of the loan as $5,608,646.

No.BLA201011 supported “Package 1” [Highway Section from Pinnaduwa to Kodagoda (30.8 km to 45 km)], while No.BLA201012 supported Package 2 [Highway Section from Kodagoda to Godagama (45 km to 61.05 km) and balance work in Galle Port Access Road]. The face values of these two BCLs are unknown. However, the combined value of these two BCL is $138.21 million. We therefore record these two BCLs in a single project record (Project ID#45520). 
Both of these loans carried the same terms: an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + a 2.40% margin, maturity of 15 years, 4 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, 0.3% management fee, and 6% exposure fee. The average 6-month LIBOR rate in February 2011 was 0.464%, so the total interest rate is coded as 0.464% + 2.40%, or 2.864%. 
The Southern Transport Development Project (STDP) is the largest greenfield road project ever implemented in Sri Lanka. The purpose of the STDP was to assist the development of the economy of Sri Lanka’s Southern Province by encouraging growth in industries, tourism, fisheries and agriculture by connecting the access roads to the country’s first access controlled highway. The STDP was financed by the Government of Sri Lanka and five development partners (Asian Development Bank, Japan Bank for International Corporation, Nordic Development Fund, Swedish International Development Association, and China Eximbank). 
The project involved the construction of the Southern Expressway, which is an access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers (km) from Kottawa to Godagama; the Galle Port Access Road, which is a 5.5 km long access road from the Southern Expressway to Galle; and a road safety component. The Southern Expressway was divided into four sections for financing purposes. Section I is from Kottawa to Dodangoda. Section II is from Dodangoda to Kurundugahahethekma. Section III is from Kurundugahahethekma to Pinnaduwa. Section IV is a 30.8 km segment of the expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in Section IV. 
 China National Technical Import & Export Corporation (CNTIC) was the contractor responsible for implementation of Package 1 and Package 2. It signed an EPC contract on June 11, 2010. It commenced work in April 2011. It completed its work in January 2014 and the Pinnaduwa-Godagama section of the Southern Expressway was opened to traffic on March 16, 2014. Upon completion of the Southern Expressway (STDP) Project, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) conducted a project completion report. It rated the project as “effective” in achieving the expected outcomes, which included an expressway in operational condition and increased economic opportunities for residents in the southern region of the country. 
 The travel time between Colombo and Matara was reduced to 1.5 hours as of March 2014. Also, after the opening of the Southern Expressway, there was a reduction in the fatal accident rate on the Galle Road. In 2010, the accident rate was 25 per 1 million vehicles; in 2011, it went down to 21 per 1 million vehicles, and in 2012 it was 16 per 1 million vehicles. Two new industrial estates (Koggala and Mirijjawila) were set up in the Southern Province and Hambanthota Port and Hambanthota International Airport were built after the STDP project started. While the expressway section from Kottawa to Galle has only been operating since November 2011, the social and economic investments made under the STDP since 2000 have attracted borrower and private sector investment to the Southern Province.
Overall, there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all three districts in the Southern Province. The four sample villages (Godagama, Kabaragala, Paraduwa, Yaddehimulla) in the ADB’s design and monitoring framework are in Galle and Matara districts. Yakdehimulla and Kabaragala are close to the Galle Port Access Road and the Pinnaduwa Interchange. The other two villages mainly benefited from the section of the Southern Expressway funded by China Eximbank. The ADB’s project completion report notes that there was an increase in socioeconomic conditions in all four villages. 
 This project supported a 30.8 km section of the Southern Expressway from Pinnaduwa to Godagama. There are 3 interchanges (Imaduwa, Kokmaduwa and Godagama) and 9 bridges in this section. This China Eximbank-financed project also supported balance work in Galle Port Access Road. The Southern Expressway is a access-controlled expressway of about 126 kilometers from Kottawa to Godagama.

China Eximbank covered 90% of the cost of the $79,528,000 EPC contract value (captured in Project ID#33184). The remaining 10% was funded by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). This project involved an onshore component and an offshore component. The onshore component of the project involved 29 diesel and kerosene storage tanks and all the matching facilities. The offshore component of the project involved a one-point mooring system and a 5.6 km submarine oil transmission pipeline. China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation — a construction subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation specializing in the construction of refineries and chemical fertilizer plants connected to refineries, and mining plants — was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. Project implementation began in July 2001 and the Muthurajawela tank farm became operational on May 27, 2004. With the construction of this tank farm, Sri Lanka’s storage capacity for finished petroleum products increased by 250,000 tonnes. Muthurajawela tank farm consists of 21 tanks of 10,000 m3 capacity and 8 tanks of 5,000 m3 capacity. These tanks store and distribute diesel and kerosene. Along with the tanks, CPC installed a new SPBM system, where 60,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) ships could use the buoy for discharging imported finished products direct from sea to tanks via a submarine pipeline. This terminal includes a loading facility to distribute products by road tankers. However, rail transportation of petroleum products stored in the Muthurajawela tank farm is constrained due to the absence of a railway line. At the time of project completion, a dual pipeline transport systems named the ‘cross country pipeline’ with a length of 6.5 km was expected to link Muthurajawela tank farm with the Supugaskanda facility.","https://www.ceylonexpeditions.com/muthurajawela-wetland-sanctuary-boat-ride-sri-lanka#:~:text=Muthurajawela%20is%20a%20coastal%20wetland,of%20western%20province%20Sri%20Lanka.

Metallurgical Corporation of China Ltd (MCC) is the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project commenced on August 20, 2014. Its originally anticipated completion date was June 30, 2019. However, this project faced delays due to poor contractor performance, several houses refusing to vacate, and land acquisition problems at Kadawatha IC due to trade union activities in the survey department.. This project was ultimately completed on November 7, 2019.
Phase III of the Outer Circular Highway Project involves the construction of a 9.32 km segment of the Outer Circular Highway that runs from Kadawatha to Kerawalapitiya.

"904",33184,"China Eximbank provides $72 million loan for Muthurajawela Oil Tank Farm Project (Linked to Project ID#70565)","On January 17, 2001, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a $72 million loan agreement for the Muthurajawela Tank Farm Project. This loan carried a maturity of 20 years and a grace period of 5 years. This project involved an onshore component and an offshore component. The onshore component of the project involved 29 diesel and kerosene storage tanks and all the matching facilities.
The offshore component of the project involved a one-point mooring system and a 5.6 km submarine oil transmission pipeline. China Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Corporation — a construction subsidiary of China National Petroleum Corporation specializing in the construction of refineries and chemical fertilizer plants connected to refineries, and mining plants — was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. 
China Eximbank covered 90% of the cost of the $79,528,000 EPC contract value. The remaining 10% was funded by Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC). Project implementation began in July 2001 and the Muthurajawela tank farm became operational on May 27, 2004. With the construction of this tank farm, Sri Lanka’s storage capacity for finished petroleum products increased by 250,000 tonnes. 
Muthurajawela tank farm consists of 21 tanks of 10,000 m3 capacity and 8 tanks of 5,000 m3 capacity. These tanks store and distribute diesel and kerosene. Along with the tanks, CPC installed a new SPBM system, where 60,000 DWT (deadweight tonnage) ships could use the buoy for discharging imported finished products direct from sea to tanks via a submarine pipeline. This terminal includes a loading facility to distribute products by road tankers. 
However, rail transportation of petroleum products stored in the Muthurajawela tank farm is constrained due to the absence of a railway line. At the time of project completion, a dual pipeline transport systems named the ‘cross country pipeline’ with a length of 6.5 km was expected to link Muthurajawela tank farm with the Supugaskanda facility. 
STAFF_NOTE: Some sources indicated that China Eximbank provided a “mixed credit” (perhaps a buyer’s credit and a government concessional loan). However, AidData has not yet identified any official evidence of multiple loans with different terms for this project. This project is linked to a $3.6 million USD grant for the Muthurajawela oil tank farm in 2000 (captured in #70565).","http://en.people.cn/english/200012/05/eng20001205_56902.html, https://www.google.com/maps/place/Muthurajawela+By+Boat/@7.0731448,79.7269704,11z/data=!4m12!1m6!3m5!1s0x0:0x7233cda4743cb8b4!2sMuthurajawela+Visitor+Centre!8m2!3d7.0788942!4d79.8530128!3m4!1s0x0:0x491653e18dd08152!8m2!3d7.1110813!4d79.8711848","ADM2",79.88,7.04,"Wattala","Division","LKA.7.13_1","Sri Lanka"

The contractor responsible for project implementation is China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC). A groundbreaking ceremony for the project took place on December 5, 2014 (prior to loan approval). As of January 31 2018, the Sri Lankan Department of Project Management and Monitoring reported that the project had achieved a “physical progress” rate of 20.27%. 
This project has been plagued by controversy. In May 2018, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga demanded that this project be suspended and investigated on the grounds that it was overpriced. The decision to grant a $229.5 million contract to the China Machinery Engineering Corporation (CMEC) in 2012 was based on an unsolicited proposal from the firm. Even while the Rajapaksa administration was still in power, a Cabinet appointed procurement committee noticed a major difference between the cost estimated by the NWSDB engineers for pipe laying and other activities and the higher prices estimated by CMEC. However, a review committee set up after the 2015 change of government recommended continuation of the CMEC project. 
The Auditor General’s (AG) Department also raised concerns about the qualifications of CMEC to undertake such a major project. It noted that the company’s portfolio showed no specialization in water supply projects, and that in the experience section of CMEC’s project proposal it listed the experience of several other companies (China National Machinery Import and Export Cooperation and Tiagin Water Industry Engineering and Equipment Co. Ltd.). 
The AG Department also highlighted that even though government procurement guidelines state that only a maximum of 20 percent can be paid as an advance to a contractor, an advance payment of 34 percent was made to CMEC. Then, in a letter dated May 17, 2018 to the Secretary of the Treasury, Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunge, the Attorney General recommended that a complaint be filed at the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC) since it appeared that the project was mired in graft.","http://www.sundayobserver.lk/2018/08/12/news/cmec-attanagalla-water-project-ag-points-%E2%80%98colossal%E2%80%99-squander-public-funds, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attanagalla_Divisional_Secretariat, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minuwangoda","ADM2",79.99,7.07,"Gampaha","Division","LKA.7.5_1","Sri Lanka"

The goal of this project is to provide safe drinking water via pipes to all 45 Grama Niladdhari divisions in Katana Divisional Secretariat covering 50% of the population in the area (similar to Project ID #53566). To do so, the project will, over 3 years, construct a water intake structure with a capacity of 42,000 m3/day, a water treatment plant of 18,000m3/day, a ground reservoir of 1,500 m3 capacity, a raw water and treated water transmission mains totaling up to an approximate length of 50 Km, elevated towers of 1,500 m3 capacity, a distribution network of 135 KM, and facilities to operate and maintain the water supply scheme. The project is expected to commence operations in 2021 and is in the tender evaluation stage as of March 2018. The project is being implemented by the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board. According to a March 2018 Sri Lanka news source, the Sri Lanka National Water Supply & Drainage Board Assistant General Manager for the North Central Province Sudath Ratnayake indicated that the CDB loan for this project carries an interest rate of 1-1.5 per cent plus London Inter Bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and a maturity of 15 years. The interest rate is coded based on the 6-Month LIBOR rate at time of signing of the loan agreement. The average 6 month LIBOR (USD) for August 2017 was 1.454%. The least concessional base interest rate from the 1-1.5 per cent range was used to calculate the total interest rate. The total interest rate is therefore coded as 1.5% + 1.454%, or 2.954%. The total project is expected to cost $120.5 million; the remaining $18 million will be provided by the Bank of Ceylon, a state-owned, commercial bank in Sri Lanka.

Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. 
Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbor Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. 
However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems. As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank. China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017.

"1168",33369,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.3 billion government concessional loan for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project","On December 23, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 1.3 billion for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, commitment fee of 0.5%, and management fee of 0.5%. The purpose of the $209 million project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport. 
China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building. Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony. 
This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meter terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed “the world’s emptiest international airport.” 
Sri Lanka’s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, “when I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she’d stamped that day. She said, ‘One’.” Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. The national carrier released a public statement that read: “[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan’s efforts to turn itself around. … SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.” 
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project is located in the town of Mattala, 18 km (11 mi) from Hambantota.

"1171",33329,"China Eximbank provides $65 million buyer’s credit loan for Hambantota Bunkering Project","On August 6, 2009, China Eximbank and the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) signed a $65,094,508 buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (No. BLA0902) for the Hambantota Bunkering Project. The BCL carried the following terms: 15 year maturity, 3 year grace period, interest rate of 6.5%, 0.3% commitment fee, and 0.3% management fee. This project involved the construction of a bunkering facility at Hambantota Port. 
The bunkering facility and tank farm are located 1.2 km from the Hambantota waterfront, and are connected to the oil terminal through a pipeline. The facility has 14 tanks (total storage of 80,000 m3). Eight of these storage tanks carry bunker oil for ships and six of the storage tank tanks carry aviation fuel and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). This project was part of a broader effort by SLPA and the Government of Sri Lanka to position Hambantota port as a refueling and service point for cargo ships, which pass a few kilometers away off the southern tip of the country on one of the world’s busiest east-west shipping lanes. 
 The contract for the Hambantota Bunkering Project was awarded to the China Huanqiu Contracting and Engineering Corporation. The project began in 2009 and its mechanical works were completed on October 10, 2011. Bunkering operations began after a project completion ceremony on June 22, 2014, and they are run by the SPLA. 
 However, these operations were late suspended due to a loss of $19.9 million as a result of irregularities. 17,818 metric tons of marine gas oil were purchased by the Government of Sri Lanka for oil bunkering at the tank farm yard, but SLPA was only able to sell 3,235 metric tons due to the poor quality of oil. 
 The bunkering facility is located 1.2 km from Hambantota Port (also known as the Magampura Mahinda Rajapaksa Port), which is a maritime port in Hambantota, Sri Lanka.

 Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project envisaged the construction of a large industrial area and a shipyard facility and required the acquisition of 1,500 hectares of land. It involved the construction of a quay wall (2140 m long) to accommodate 6 container berths, oil terminal (300 meters long), yard & roads, a flyover bridge, deepening of entrance channel (450 m wide, 840 m long, 18 meter deep), 2 feeder berths, construction of an artificial island (50 Ha) & handling facilities, and excavating a new basin area. Upon completion, it was envisaged that the port in Hambantota, deeper than the one at Colombo, would be used as a refueling and docking station for the Sri Lankan Navy. 
 
 The contractors responsible for project implementation were China Communications Construction Company and China Harbour Engineering Com. Ltd. Phase II of Hambantota Port Development Project was formally launched on November 18, 2010. However, construction did not begin until September 2012. The project was originally slated for completion in November 2015. However, the project encountered various delays and problems. As of December 31, 2017, the project had achieved 96% physical completion rate. A formal port handover ceremony took place on December 11, 2017. 
 
 Hambantota port ultimately proved to be commercially nonviable under host country ownership, and the Sri Lankan government could not service its loans to China Eximbank. China Merchant Port Holdings (CMPH) — a Chinese state-owned enterprise — eventually offered to effectively convert the debt into equity by providing a cash payment of US$1.1 billion to SLPA in exchange for an 85 percent ownership stake in the port and the right to operate and develop it for 99 years. CMPH therefore absorbed the risk of managing a stranded asset that would have otherwise been borne by the Sri Lankan government. SLPA finalized it concession agreement with CMPH on July 29, 2017. 
 
 Staff Note: Multiple sources refer to a $808 million or $809 million China Eximbank loan for the Phase II of the Hambantota Port Development Project.

"1180",33369,"China Eximbank provides RMB 1.3 billion government concessional loan for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project","On December 23, 2009, China Eximbank and the Government of Sri Lanka signed a government concessional loan (GCL) agreement worth RMB 1.3 billion for the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project. The GCL carried the following terms: 2% interest rate, 20-year maturity, 5-year grace period, commitment fee of 0.5%, and management fee of 0.5%. The purpose of the $209 million project was to construct an alternative airport, located in Mattala, to the Bandaranaike international Airport. 
China Harbour Engineering Company was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project involved the construction of a 4 km runway, a parking apron, a taxiway connecting the runaway and the apron, a terminal building, cargo storage, a fuel arm, and a fire service building. Construction began on November 17, 2009. The construction of the runway, apron and taxiways was completed ahead of schedule in February 2012. On January 24, 2013, Sri Lanka’s Minister of Civil Aviation Piyankara Jayaratne reported to parliament that the airport would be declared open on March 18, 2013. On October 16, 2012, a Hawker Beechcraft B200 King Air of the Pakistan Civil Aviation Authority became the first aircraft to land at the new airport. The airport was opened for flight operations, as planned, on March 18, 2013. President Rajapaksa, his ministers, and other dignitaries arrived in a SriLankan Airlines Airbus A340 to attend the inauguration ceremony. 
This project was plagued by cost overruns and controversy. It ultimately cost $243.7 million to implement the project. However, the original budget for the project was $209 million. The Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is also widely considered to be a commercial failure. The construction of the 12,000 square meter terminal building was originally designed to support as many as one million travelers per year, and the government envisioned major international carriers bringing travelers from Beijing, Chennai, Dubai, Riyadh, and Bangkok to Hambantota for sporting events, international conferences, eco-tourism, and nightlife. However, it was eventually dubbed “the world’s emptiest international airport.” 
Sri Lanka’s aviation minister reported to parliament in 2014 that the airport had only earned $123 in revenue in a single month, and when a visiting journalist asked a senior government official about the airport, he indicated, “when I visited the airport there, I asked the sole immigration officer how many passports she’d stamped that day. She said, ‘One’.” Within only a few years of becoming fully operational, the airport was running an annual financial loss of $18 million. Consequently, the airport failed to generate sufficient revenue to facilitate loan repayment. in January 2015, Maithripala Sirisena was elected President of Sri Lanka and one of his first orders was to allow SriLankan Airlines to cancel all flights to Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport. The national carrier released a public statement that read: “[T]he reality is Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport is not needed and is a distraction in Sri Lankan’s efforts to turn itself around. … SriLankan Airlines continues to be highly unprofitable and having to meet the political requirement of developing and operating a second hub [in Hambantota district] will make it even harder to meet its targets for financial improvement.” 
Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport Project is located in the town of Mattala, 18 km (11 mi) from Hambantota.

STAFF_NOTE: Some reports suggest that the face value of the China Eximbank GCL was $209 million. However, this figure refers to the total cost of the project (prior to cost overruns). In correspondence with AidData’s Executive Director, the Director of the China and AIIB Division with the External Resources Department of Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs confirmed that USD loan value of the RMB-denominated China Eximbank loan is approximately $190 million.

The BCL carried the following terms: an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2.8% margin, 12 year maturity, 2 year grace period, 0.7% commitment fee, and 0.5% management fee. 
 The average 6-month LIBOR rate in September 2010 was 0.478%. The total interest rate is therefore coded as 0.478% + 2.80%, or 3.278%. The proceeds from the BCL were to be used to procure materials for the provision of electricity to 80,000 consumers living in Northern Province by constructing 400 rural electrification schemes. 
 China National Complete Plant Import & Export Corporation (COMPLANT) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Its work was overseen by the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB).

In July 2014, the Public Accounts Committee voted to approve the changes to the loan.

The project broke ground on December 9, 2014, when the President of Maldives Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom laid the ‎foundation stone of the 704 housing units to be constructed in Hulhumalé., as reported by the President's Office.

The terms of the loan were as follows: 1.75% interest rate, 25-year maturity, and a 5-year grace period. The Government of Nepal used the proceeds of the loan to develop an on-lending arrangement (through a “Subsidiary Loan Agreement”) with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) on April 15, 2011. These loan agreements went into effect on June 1, 2011. 

However, in 2013, the scope of the project was expanded and the face value of these loan agreements were increased to $114.7 million. The Upper Trishuli 3A hydroelectric power plant project involved the construction a 60 MW run-of-river (ROR) plant with annual energy generation of 460 GWh. The plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts. On May 31, 2010, China Gezhouba Group Co. Ltd. (CGGC) signed a commercial (EPC) contract with NEA to implement all civil, electro-mechanical, and hydro-mechanical works, including gradation of the 11.5 km long access road, construction of a steel bridge over Trishuli River, construction of temporary camp at headworks, and excavation of Adit no. 1 and head pond excavation. Northwest Engineering Corporation Limited (previously known as Northwest HydroConsulting Engineers) was selected as the contractor responsible for construction supervision. CGGC received a “Commencement of Work Order” on June 1, 2011. 

The project was initiated on November 23, 2011 and it encountered various delays due to disputes over whether to build powerhouse underground or overground, disputes about whether to increase the capacity of the project, damages to the access roads leading to the project site (resulting from landslides that were triggered by an April 2015 earthquake), and a blockade imposed by India. On May 26, 2019, the first unit of the plant was successfully connected to the grid.  The second unit was successfully connected to the grid later in 2019. The hydroelectric power plant was officially completed and inaugurated on November 18, 2019. The electricity that is now generated by the plant mainly serves people in Kathmandu and it reportedly fulfills seven percent of the country’s total electricity demand. 

The 60 MW Upper Trishuli 3A Hydroelectric Power Plant is located near Simle village within Kispang Rural Municipality on the borders of the Rasuwa and Nuwakot districts.

Then, in June 2011, the Chinese Government signed another agreement to construct the Tatopani (Zhangmu) Customs Inspection Station near the dry port (also known as an inland clearance depot or ICD) at Larcha and hand it over to the Government of Nepal after completion. 

The project involved the installation of different facilities to ease customs clearance, such as a cargo warehouse, parking lot, and a digital truck scale to weigh goods. The purpose of the project was to improve the border customs clearance conditions and ease the flow of vehicles and people in the border areas in Nepal and to promote the development of bilateral trade between two countries. Beijing Real Estate Group Co., Ltd. (北京房地集团承) was the contractor responsible for implementation of the project, and on December 20, 2012, construction commenced. However, during project implementation, the Inland Clearance Depot (ICD) in Larcha was ravaged by floods and earthquakes. Beijing Real Estate Development Group reportedly abandoned the project in 2015. The project was resumed in April 2018, and, according to CGTN, was completed by China Railway 14th Contruction Bureau Co. According to ""China Aid Post-Quake Reconstruction Projects in Nepal,"" the project was completed and opened in April 2019.

As of November 2014, the completion of the dry port will be delayed as a result of transportation problems created by a landslide in Jure, Sindhupalchok, and the sweeping away of the Bhotekoshi bridge by floods. The bridge was crucial to transporting construction materials to the dry port. The government has also failed to clear houses along the road connecting Miteri Bridge and the dry port. The road expansion and construction of a bridge over Bhotekoshi are included in the dry port contract. At this point only 60-65 percent of the construction work has been completed. Technical experts at the project say at the current pace of work, it will take another one year from the deadline to complete the project.","","ADM2",81.14,29.27,"Seti","Administrative Zone","NPL.3.2_1","Nepal"

Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) is a project company that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, which is a 969 MW run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. 
 
 The project was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of ChatterKalas. The project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually. 
 
 According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submited to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) is being financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounts to PKR 401,416 million Pakistani rupees (PKR), which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Foreign sources of debt financing include $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development, and $1.024 billion from China Eximbank.

 The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the PBC loan to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 12%. As of June 30 2017, the PBC loan had been fully disbursed and the $191.067 million of the BCL had been disbursed. The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium called CGGC-CMEC. It was comprised of Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. 
 
 In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. Project implementation then began on February 9, 2008. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The project was expected to achieve its commercial operation date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid. This project was also plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.

In October 2009, the PPIB approved the Feasibility Study Report of the project and in November 2013, National Electric Power Regulatory Authority granted KPCL a generation license to develop a 720 MW hydro-based generation facility at Karot village, District Rawalpindi, in Punjab province. The project is located on Jhelum River, near Karot Bridge. It is the 4th among 5 Cascade HPPs to be developed along Jhelum River. KPCL is 93% owned by China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, a subsidiary of China Three Gorges Corporation, and 7% owned by Pakistan's Associated Technologies. On January 9, 2015, KPCL completed a EPC Tender evaluation and awarded the EPC contract to Yangtze Three Gorges Technology & Economy Development Co., Ltd (TGDC) and China Machinery Engineering Corporation Consortium. The project will be undertaken on a build-own-operate-transfer basis. Construction began in 2015 and is expected to be completed in 2021. The project is designated a priority project under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and a flagship project under Belt and Road Initiative. Project is part of the $2 billion Karot power projects, focusing on hydro and wind power, under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor reported to be completed by 2018. The project will feature a single power generation complex with an installed capacity will be 720-megawatts with four units of 180-megawatts each. The power structure layout will include a roc-filled dam, spillway, powerhouse, diversion tunnels, head-race power tunnels and a tail-race tunnel end. The project itself is distributed as 80% in Punjab (powerhouse) and 20% in Azad Jammu and Kashmir (reservoirs). According to an interview with the chief accountant from China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, the total cost of the project is 1.75 billion USD, with a debt-equity ratio of 80:20. The project achieved financial closure on February 22, 2017. According to IJGlobal, the 80% debt component was financed by loans from China Development Bank, China Exim Bank, China Silk Road Fund and International Finance Corporation (IFC), each one worth 315 Million USD, along with an additional 100 Million USD loan from IFC. This project records the loans from the Chinese banks. For the equity component, China Three Gorges Corporation invested 316.20 Million USD, while Associated technologies invested 23.90 Million USD (captured in #54012). Sinosure provided loan insurance for the Chinese bank loans. The IMF puts the loan interest rate at 5.11%, with a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 5 years. It was additionally reported that there is a 30-year concession period. On April 20, 2015, China's $40 billion Silk Road Fund signed a memorandum of understanding with China Three Gorges Corporation and the PPIB on the development of Pakistan's hydropower project, pledging to finance the project through equity investment in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited, and participating in a loan syndicate made up of Chinese banks. As of 2017, the Silk Road Fund has disbursed 1.65 Billion USD. The Silk Road Fund also owns 15% of China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Company as of 2017. On March 14, 2017, IFC announced that it will invest $100 million in the Karot Hydropower Project, and reported that it acquired a 15% stake in China Three Gorges South Asia Investment Limited in 2015. IFC stated that this investment is its first major collaboration with the China Export Import Bank, China Development Bank, and Silk Road Fund. The first unit is projected to begin power generation in 2020, coming online prior to its deadline. The Chinese firm in charge of the project will hand over this project to Pakistani government after the 30-year concession period has ended.

"761",54087,"China Eximbank provides $576 million preferential buyer's credit for the 969 MW Neelum-Jhelum Hydroelectric Project (Linked to project #35266) (non-CPEC, IPP)","On September 29, 2016, China Eximbank and the Government of Pakistan signed a $576 million preferential buyer’s credit loan agreement for the Neelum-Jhelum Hydropower Project. Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) is a project company that was created to design, construct, own, operate and maintain the Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Project, which is a 969 MW run-of-the-river project in the State of Azad Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistan’s Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) claims that it is the largest hydropower project undertaken by WAPDA since the completion of Mangla, Tarbela and Ghazi Barotha Hydropower Projects. 
 
 The project was designed to divert the water from river Neelum through a tunnel. The tunnel intake is at Nauseri 41 km northeast of Muzaffarabad and the underground powerhouse is being constructed at Chatter Kalas, 22 km south of Muzaffarabad. The diverted water will produce electric power by passing through the turbines and thereafter this water will be released back into the River Jhelum, about 4 km south of Chatter Kalas. The project was expected to produce 5.15 billion units of electricity annually. According to a March 2018 tariff petition that NJHPC submitted to Pakistan’s National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA), the total project cost of 506,579 million Pakistani rupees (PKR) was financed according to a debt-equity-grant ratio of 79:9:11. The total amount of debt financing amounts to PKR 401,416 million Pakistani rupees (PKR), which is roughly equivalent to $3.823 billion. Foreign sources of debt financing include $358 million from the Islamic Development Bank, $181 million from the Saudi Fund for Development, $81 million from the OPEC Fund for International Development, $74 million from the Kuwait Fund for Arabic Economic Development, and $1.024 billion from China Eximbank. 
 
 Two separate loans were secured from China Eximbank: a $448 million China Eximbank buyer’s credit loan (this record) in 2013 and a $576 million preferential buyer’s credit loan (Project ID#54087) in 2016. The terms of the buyer’s credit loan (BCL) were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (0.409%) plus a 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the BCL to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 15%. The terms of the preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan were as follows: 20 year maturity. 8 year grace period, interest rate of 6-month LIBOR (1.058%) plus 2.8% margin, 0.75% management fee, 0.5% commitment fee. The Government of Pakistan used the proceeds of the PBC loan to on-lend to Neelum Jhelum Hydropower Company (Pvt) Ltd (NJHPC) at an interest rate of 12%. As of June 30, 2017, the PBC loan had been fully disbursed and the $191.067 million of the BCL had been disbursed. 
 
 The EPC contractor for this project was a Chinese consortium called CGGC-CMEC. It was comprised of Gezhouba Group and China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation. In January 2008, a letter of commencement was issued to the EPC contractor. Project implementation then began on February 9, 2008. According to WAPDA, 90% of the construction works were completed by March 2018. The project was officially completed on April 13, 2018. The project was expected to achieve its commercial operation date (COD) by December 2018. However, it is unclear if the project achieved this goal. By April 11, 2019, the project had injected 2,400 GWh of energy into the national grid. This project was also plagued by controversy. Transparency International Pakistan alleged that the procurement of tunnel-boring machines (TBM), which were meant to speed up the excavation of the remaining tunnels, resulted in $74 million in kickbacks.

"793",35122,"China Export-Import Bank commits supplier's credit of US$102 million to Pakistan for white oil pipeline","In 2002, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) provided a $102 million supplier's credit to Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) for the White Oil Pipeline Project. Pak-Arab Pipeline Company (PARCO/PAPCO) and China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation (CPECC) signed an agreement, under which the Chinese firm would supply equipment and materials for the construction of white oil pipeline from Port Qasim, Karachi to Mahmud Kot, Multan. 
 
 This project involved the construction of a 786 km, 26-inch diameter, high-speed diesel oil pipeline that runs from Karachi to Mahmoodkot. A joint venture company (special purpose vehicle) called Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) was created to finance, design, implement, and maintain this project. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. (PARCO ) -- a joint venture company between Government of Pakistan and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi -- holds a 51% majority share in PAPCO, while Shell, PSO and TOTAL PARCO Marketing Limited hold 26%, 12% and 11% equity shares, respectively. 
 
 On August 7, 2001, Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) signed an EPC contract with the China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation – Techno (Pvt) Ltd. Consortium. The total cost of the project was $480 million and it was implemented according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio ($120 million of equity and $360 million of debt financing). 
 
 The project reached financial close in 2002, with China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) providing a $102 supplier's credit and local banks providing additional debt financing to PAPCO. In order to provide this supplier credit to PAPCO, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) secured a $102 million export seller's credit facility with a 10-year maturity from China Eximbank. 
 
 The $481 million project would provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for both crude and refined products transportation and added with the completion of the pipeline a more comprehensive, safer, cost effective, demand responsive and eco-friendly pipeline network will be available to meet the country’s growing needs for energy. The 817 km-long and 26 inch diameter pipeline has an initial capacity of transporting eight million tons refined petroleum products, and 12 million tons white oil per annum. 
 
 The project groundbreaking ceremony was on May 31, 2001. The project reached its commercial operation date on March 1, 2005. It was official inaugurated on completed on August 26, 2005. 
 
 Out of the total cost of $481 million, the foreign component stands at $120 million, while local component stands at Rs 20.657 billion. The debt part of the foreign currency cost is being financed by export credit agencies (ECAs) from China through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor. Three major banks — HBL, UBL and NBP—will arrange Rs12.5 billion of Rs29 billion White Oil Pipeline Project of PAPCO. Around Rs10 billion would be floated as TFCs (term finance certificates) and the remaining amount would be in the form of redeemable preference shares. The financing arrangement also includes bridge financing of Rs5 billion by the consortium banks to be made available for the project. In this regard, a meeting of the chief executives of NBP, HBL, UBL and PAPCO was held at the NBP office and memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also signed. The Rs29 billion ($480 million) white oil pipeline project is achieving financial close and the entire debt financing of $360 million including Rs12.5 billion in local currency is being arranged whereas equity financing of $120 million is in place. For this project NBP will also provide a foreign currency loan of $18 million and issue a bank guarantee of $102 million for China Exim Bank related to suppliers’ credit from CPECC, which have been selected as EPC contractor for the project.

"754",37131,"China Eximbank contributes $60 million USD to syndicated buyer's credit loan (BCL) for the 425 MW Nandipur Power Plant in Pakistan","On March 19, 2009, a syndicate of banks (including HSBC, China Eximbank, and BNP Paribas) signed a $150.151 million syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement with Northern Power Generation Company Ltd for construction of 425 MW Combined Cycle Power Project at Nandipur. The syndicated buyer’s credit facility agreement had a 10 year maturity and it was insured by Sinosure. China Eximbank contributed approximately $60 million through a USD-denominated loan tranche and a Euro-denominated loan tranche. 
 
 Northern Power Generation Company Ltd (NPGCL) is the biggest thermal generation company operating under the overall management of Pakistan Electric Power Company (PEPCO). NPGCL constructed the 425 MW Combined Cycle Power Plant at Nandipur, Nandipur near Gujranwala in the Punjab Province. The main EPC contractor was Dongfang Electric Corporation Ltd with G.E. France serving as a subcontractor. Construction began on October 16, 2008. However, the project was plagued by delays and controversy. In January 2008, under a provision of the 18th amendment, the Government of Punjab, Pakistan signed a $329 million EPC contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation of China to construct the Nandipur Power Project and paid a 10% down payment. Then, a conflict between the Ministry of Water and Power and the Ministry of Law and Justice delayed the project execution for two years from March 2010 to March 2012. 
 
 The Ministry of Law and Justice raised an objection over a violation of Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (PPRA) rules and the granting of the contract to China Dongfang Electric Corporation, which was blacklisted; the ministry further refused to vet the permissions before issuing an explanation of procedures. As a result, machinery worth $85 million remained stuck at the Karachi Port for over two years. In September 2012, the president of Dongfang Electric Corporation, Zhang Guorong, terminated the contract for the construction of the Nandipur Power Project, saying his company had suffered losses worth $85 million. 
 
 In June 2013, Pakistan's Ministry of Water and Power started renegotiating the contract with Dongfang Electric Corporation to resume work on the Nandipur Power Project. After successful negotiations, the firm agreed to resume work on the power station. On July 8, 2013, engineers of Dongfang Electric Corporation arrived in Karachi to inspect the machinery lying at the Karachi Port and to secure its release. Later, work on the project was restarted at an escalated cost. 
 
 After several delays, the project was finally inaugurated by the Prime Minister of Pakistan Nawaz Sharif on May 31, 2014. However, the plant remained operational for only five days after the inauguration and had to be shut down due to mismanagement, conflicts with the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA) over high production costs, and the use of inappropriate fuel. Since then, the plant has faced several controversies and operational failures, yielding inquiries and probes into misappropriations within the project. Ultimately, the energy produced by the Nandipur power plant was extremely expensive and the project was shut down after five days of operation.

Upon completion, the Orange Metro Line was expected to have capacity for 30,000 passenger per hour and serve 250,000 passengers per day. CR-NORINCO — a joint venture of China State Railway Group Co. Ltd. (CR) and China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) — was the entity responsible for project implementation. 
 
 The project was initially expected to begin by the end of 2014, last for 27 months, and conclude in 2018. However, it encountered various delays. The Lahore Development Authority began marking sites for demolition in August 2015, including government buildings, royal tombs, mosques, schools, and residences. Civil works were then initiated by CN-NORINCO on October 25, 2015. 
 
 Popular protests prompted the Lahore high court to suspend work surrounding heritage sites in January 2016 while the court deliberated the issue. Then, in August 2016, the Lahore high court ruled that the government could not evict people or harm the heritage sites. The Punjab provincial government challenged the ruling, and in April 2017, the Supreme Court reversed its decision, allowing construction to continue under 31 conditions to limit the disruption and damage of the project. This project was ultimately completed on December 10, 2019.

(PAPCO) for the White Oil Pipeline Project. Pak-Arab Pipeline Company (PARCO/PAPCO) and China Petroleum Engineering Construction Corporation (CPECC) signed an agreement, under which the Chinese firm would supply equipment and materials for the construction of white oil pipeline from Port Qasim, Karachi to Mahmud Kot, Multan. 
 
 This project involved the construction of a 786 km, 26-inch diameter, high-speed diesel oil pipeline that runs from Karachi to Mahmoodkot. A joint venture company (special purpose vehicle) called Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) was created to finance, design, implement, and maintain this project. Pak-Arab Refinery Ltd. (PARCO ) -- a joint venture company between Government of Pakistan and the Emirate of Abu Dhabi -- holds a 51% majority share in PAPCO, while Shell, PSO and TOTAL PARCO Marketing Limited hold 26%, 12% and 11% equity shares, respectively. 
 
 On August 7, 2001, Pak-Arab Pipeline Company Ltd. (PAPCO) signed an EPC contract with the China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation – Techno (Pvt) Ltd. Consortium. The total cost of the project was $480 million and it was implemented according to a 75:25 debt-to-equity ratio ($120 million of equity and $360 million of debt financing). 
 
 The project reached financial close in 2002, with China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) providing a $102 supplier's credit and local banks providing additional debt financing to PAPCO. In order to provide this supplier credit to PAPCO, China Petroleum Engineering and Construction Company (CPECC) secured a $102 million export seller's credit facility with a 10-year maturity from China Eximbank. 
 
 The $481 million project would provide a safer and cost-effective alternative for both crude and refined products transportation and added with the completion of the pipeline a more comprehensive, safer, cost effective, demand responsive and eco-friendly pipeline network will be available to meet the country’s growing needs for energy. The 817 km-long and 26 inch diameter pipeline has an initial capacity of transporting eight million tons refined petroleum products, and 12 million tons white oil per annum. 
 
 The project groundbreaking ceremony was on May 31, 2001. The project reached its commercial operation date on March 1, 2005. It was official inaugurated on completed on August 26, 2005. 
 
 Out of the total cost of $481 million, the foreign component stands at $120 million, while local component stands at Rs 20.657 billion. The debt part of the foreign currency cost is being financed by export credit agencies (ECAs) from China through Engineering, Procurement and Construction (EPC) contractor. Three major banks — HBL, UBL and NBP—will arrange Rs12.5 billion of Rs29 billion White Oil Pipeline Project of PAPCO. Around Rs10 billion would be floated as TFCs (term finance certificates) and the remaining amount would be in the form of redeemable preference shares. The financing arrangement also includes bridge financing of Rs5 billion by the consortium banks to be made available for the project. In this regard, a meeting of the chief executives of NBP, HBL, UBL and PAPCO was held at the NBP office and memorandum of understanding (MoU) was also signed. The Rs29 billion ($480 million) white oil pipeline project is achieving financial close and the entire debt financing of $360 million including Rs12.5 billion in local currency is being arranged whereas equity financing of $120 million is in place. For this project NBP will also provide a foreign currency loan of $18 million and issue a bank guarantee of $102 million for China Exim Bank related to suppliers’ credit from CPECC, which have been selected as EPC contractor for the project.

 China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. It used Hualon One technology (the CNNC's third-generation nuclear reactor design) to construct Units 2 and 3 of the Karachi Nuclear Power Plant. The groundbreaking ceremony for the project was held on November 26, 2013. A major milestone was reached at the K-2 reactor when so-called ""cold functional tests"" began on November 26, 2019. Cold functional tests are carried out to confirm whether the main system and its supporting facilities are properly installed and ready to operate under high-pressure conditions. The project's expected completion date is in 2020. 
 
 STAFF_NOTE: It is unclear if the borrower of these loans is the Government of Pakistan or a special purpose vehicle (SPV). Several media reports suggests that the Government of Pakistan insisted that the borrower be an SPV so that it could keep the K-2/K-3 debt “off its books”. Other media reports suggest that the Government of Pakistan is the borrower and that it on-lent the proceeds of the China Eximbank loans to Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAE).

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement (No. BLA06015, #6015) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 21, 2006 and June 21, 2026. As of December 31, 2018, $2,519,773 USD was still outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. 

The initial estimated value of the project was $281.3 million USD.The purpose of this project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid. According to Xinhua, the project also intended to realize the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build the transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%. 

Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on September 16, 2006. The North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009, according to TBEA's report. The construction of the 325 km, 500 kV south–north power transmission line reportedly enabled Tajikistan to become independent of the Uzbek power transmission network and to distribute electricity throughout the country.

Then, in 2014, the Export-Import Bank of China provided two loans — an RMB 929,977,078 government concessional loan (GCL) (captured in project ID#46211) and a $178,969,220 USD preferential buyer’s credit loan (PBC) (captured in project ID#71137) for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project (for the GCL loan amount, see pg. 87 of ""Program Appraisal Document on a Proposed Grant...""; for the PBC loan amount, see ""Information on existing state investment projects""). Both of these loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament on January 14, 2015. The GCL loan was contracted with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and it carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, and 1.5% interest rate (see ""РАМОЧНОЕ СОГЛАШЕНИЕ между Правительством Китайской Народной Республики и Правительством Республики Таджикистан о предоставлении Китайской Народной Республикой Республике Таджикистан льготного кредита""). The PBC loan has a 20 year maturity, 9 year grace period, and 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan contributed $17,443,400 USD. In total, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan contracted $331,058,220 USD of China Eximbank debt for Phase 2 of the 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project. The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from the GCL and the PBC loan to on-lend to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik”. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

The subsidiary GCL loan agreement (#TАJ 2014-028-2) was signed between Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan and OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” on December 18, 2014. It carried an interest rate of 5% and a maturity of 25 years. Its final maturity date was set to August 21, 2039.

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

This power plant is located in Dushanbe. Its exact locational coordinates are available at http://globalenergyobservatory.org/geoid/41775.

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan"").

It is also important to note that the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy reported in 2009 that TBEA was to receive mining rights in return for the project, before this exchange took place.

This project was also supported by a $281.1 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan from the Export-Import Bank of China (see Project ID#39989).

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan had signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project.China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan tunnel. The project was wholly completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

The purpose of this project — also known as the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253-meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047-meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.

The Chinese accounted for 10% of the registered capital ($300,000 USD), while Tajikistan accounted for 90%. The joint venture had a period of 30 years. The joint venture used a RMB 50 million government loan provided in 1994 to technically transform the tobacco factory, and the Chinese side provided cigarette and printing production lines. After the transformation, the production capacity of the factory was 5 billion cigarettes per year. The construction officially started in November 1998 and the project was completed in February 2001, and was officially handed over to Tajikistan in November 2001. However, the project was shelved because of tariff issues until October 2002. After that, the tobacco factory began trial production; producing 80 cases (800,000 cigarettes) of cigarettes per day, according to Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Tajikistan in 2003.

The joint venture was to repay the RMB 50 million loan in installments from December 1, 2002. Since the joint venture tobacco factory was in a state of intermittent operation at that time, the supply of raw materials required was not timely, and revenue was not yet generated. So, Prime Minister Akilov of the Tajik government sent a letter to Premier Zhu Rongji in 2002 to propose debt relief or extension. A loan repayment proposal was then formally proposed with a loan period of 20 years, with a grace period of 5 years, with a reduced interest rate of 1%, according to the Economic and Commercial Office of the Chinese Embassy in Tajikistan in 2003. In 2006, the Economic and Commercial Office reported that the factory was looking for a Chinese company, in the form of our shareholding or other joint venture, to partner with it and introduce technical personnel, management experience and increase its working capital, so that the factory can operate normally.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend -- through subsidiary loan agreement No. TAJ-2017-02 (BT-039), dated 29.12.2017 -- to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 29, 2017 and August 21, 2042. As of OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. 

The project involved the construction of two 500 kV, high voltage power transmission lines with a length of approximately 100 km from the Rogun hydropower plant in the town of Obi Garm (within the district of Rogun) to Dushanbe. The Dushanbe-Obigarm project was designed to improve reliability and quantity of supplied energy and reduce losses in the Rasht Valley of Tajikistan, where the Nurabad, Rasht, Tajikabad, Tavildara and Lakhsh districts are located. The Dushanbe-Obi Garm 500-kV power transmission line would also help increase the export of Tajik electricity to neighboring countries. The connection between the power grids of Districts of Republican Subordination and the southern power grid would also be improved. According to the 03/29/2019 Sputnik article, the transmission lines were to pass through the territories of Faizabad, Vahdat, Rudaki and Varzob. A substation, Dushanbe-500 substation, was also to be constructed as part of the project. 

Chinese company Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA) was contracted to implement the project. In addition, according to PowerChina, Hubei Engineering Company Engineering Construction Company was involved in the project's implementation. Construction began on October 1, 2017. The project was completed and put into operation on November 16, 2018.

"1305",39989,"China Eximbank provides $281.1 million preferential buyer’s credit for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40351)","On June 15, 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) summit, the Export-Import Bank of China and the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan signed a $281,105,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement for the 1st Stage of the Dushanbe-Khujand-Chanak Road Construction Project. The PBC loan carried a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see loan details at ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The loan was set to disburse in 3 annual tranches. The loan disbursements were as follows (see pg.7 of ""INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND REPUBLIC OF TAJIKISTAN Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation""):
- 2007: $112.4 million USD
- 2008: $112.4 million USD
- 2009: $56.2 million USD

The project had a total cost of $295.9 million USD. This project is linked to project ID#40351, a RMB 60 million grant offered by the Chinese Government. China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. Construction began on July 11, 2006. The construction period was planned to be 38 months. The highway was commissioned in 2010, but work continued on the Shahristan  tunnel. The project was completed on October 27, 2012, with an opening ceremony for the Shahristan tunnel that was attended by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. 

Earlier, in March 2006, China and Tajikistan signed a Memorandum of Understanding that stated the terms of preferential credits issuance for promotion of economic and social development of SCO members. One of the financing projects identified was this road project. The purpose of the project — also known as the Tajikistan-Uzbekistan Highway Rehabilitation/Reconstruction Project — was to reconstruct the 354 km highway connecting Dushanbe with Khujand, the center of the northern province, and the town of Chanak on the border with Uzbekistan. The project also involved the construction of the 5253 meter Shahristan tunnel (at a cost of $88,424), the 1047 meter Dusti tunnel, the Maikhura tunnel, 39 big and small bridges, and 6 km of avalanche defenses.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

The precise face value of the GCL loan and the precise face value of the PBC loan are unknown. However, it is known that the GCL and PBC are jointly worth $20.9 million USD, and that 40% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($8.36 million) came from the RMB-denominated GCL and 60% of the total debt financing from China Eximbank ($12.54 million) came from the USD-denominated PBC (AidData learned this through correspondence with the IMF, see ""Following Up"" resource). Project ID#46215 records the GCL and project ID#71411 records the PBC.

The loans were ratified by the Tajik Parliament in June 2013 and were expected to be repaid with revenues from the traffic fines generated by this project. The total cost of the project was $22 million USD. In addition to the Chinese loans, the Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.1 million USD.

According to Ministry of Internal Affairs of the Republic of Tajikistan, the Safe City Project involved the installation of 855 CCTV cameras for round-the-clock monitoring of traffic and other movements at 75 crossroads, streets, and squares in the capital city of Dushanbe. The cameras were to record every offense committed by drivers, which would be stored and processed in a common database. Huawei Technologies Co., Ltd. was responsible for project implementation. Tajik Ministry of Internal Affairs was also responsible for the undertaking of the project.

The Safe City project and the control center were officially launched on October 31, 2013 by President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon. The Safe City Project was to be carried out in three stages; the second stage was expected to be finished in May 2014. The project was still on going as of December 2014. As of January 16, 2015, it had reportedly generated $4 million for the Tajik state budget via traffic fines. According to a Huawei report issued in February 2015, Huawei completed the project successfully.

Dushanbe 2 is a combined heat and power plant (CHP) — also known as the Dushanbe-2 Thermal Power Plant (TPS-2) — that provides heat and electricity for the residents of Dushanbe. It only operates in the winter. The 400MW Dushanbe CHP-2 Construction Project required two phases. Phase 1 (mainly constructed between 2012-2014) installed a capacity of 100 MW, while Phase 2 (constructed between 2014-2016) installed an additional capacity of 300 MW. TBEA was the contractor responsible for implementation of both phases. CHP-2 was to be fueled by coal, with the potential to switch to gas. According to State-owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission of the State Council, Inner Mongolia Electric Power Survey and Design Institute Co., Ltd. was the project designer for Phase 2. According to PowerChina, Hydro Electric Power System Engineering Company was also involved in the undertaking of Phase 2 of the project.

The first phase was scheduled to be completed and put into production before the celebration of the 20th anniversary of Tajik independence in 2011 (September 9th), and the second phase was scheduled to be completed in 2013. Phase 1 of the project began on September 8, 2009 and was put into operation on November 10, 2014. Phase 2 of the project began on May 14, 2015 and was completed on December 8, 2016.

According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon as relayed by TBEA, the plant generates 9.6 million kWh power per day and 235 trillion Kcal heat, and provided nearly 700 stable jobs to Tajiks. 150 Tajikistan technicians went to China for training, and about 100 Tajikistan operators mastered professional know-how under the guidance of Chinese experts. According to Xinhua, the completed station met 60 percent of the power demand and enabled the restart of central heating for more than 700,000 Dushanbe residents after 15 years of suspension. The completion of the Dushanbe-2 thermal power station was also declared to be the solution to Tajikistan's long-existing issue of power shortages in winter.

Some sources suggest that major delays took place after Tajikistan contracted this loan on July 4, 2009. The ceremony for the beginning of the project was clearly on September 8, 2009, but it seems project construction did not begin in earnest until 2012, when TBEA agreed to “front” $178 million for the construction of Phase 1 by borrowing directly from China Eximbank, and, in turn, the Tajik government agreed to grant TBEA exclusive rights to explore and develop gold deposits at the Eastern Duoba mine and the Upper Kumarg mine (until TBEA could recoup its investment). The Tajik government also reportedly agreed to give TBEA the rights to further mining deposits (at an unidentified location) if the profit made from the gold deposits did not cover the cost of building the power plant.

According to Kazakhstan Newsline, Tajikistan also issued a license to TBEA for the development of coal mines (see ""Chinese TBEA company says Dushanbe is ready to provide its gold mines""). Another media source, Central Asia News, said that the mineral resources were to be used to compensate the costs of the company for construction of the Dushanbe-2 in the amount of $178 million USD. It also reported that the proven reserves of 3 gold mines was to be estimated 51.7 tons of gold (see ""China’s TBEA may obtain license for development of another mine in Tajikistan"").

China Eximbank agreed to provide a $51,000,000 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan to the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan (see pg. 37 of ""Consolidated financial statements...""). This loan was intended to provide additional financing to the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project and 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. Both of these projects were supported by Export-Import Bank loans approved in 2006 (see Project ID#39984 and Project ID#39644). The terms of this PBC loan are unknown.

However, it is known that the Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between May 29, 2007 and December 21, 2028.

Aluminum fluoride is an inorganic compound used primarily in the production of aluminum. This colorless solid can be prepared synthetically, but also occurs naturally. Aluminum fluoride is an important additive for the production of aluminum by electrolysis. Together, with cryolite, it lowers the melting point to below 1000°C and increases the conductivity of the solution. Cryolite was historically used as an ore of aluminum, and later in the electrolytic processing of the aluminum-rich oxide ore bauxite. The difficulty of separating aluminum from oxygen in the oxide ores was overcome by the use of cryolite as a flux to dissolve the oxide minerals. Pure cryolite melts at 1012°C, and it can dissolve the aluminum oxides sufficiently to allow for the easy extraction of the aluminum by electrolysis. Substantial energy is still needed for both heating the materials and the electrolysis, but it is much more energy-efficient than melting the oxides themselves. Since natural cryolite is too rare to be used for this purpose, synthetic sodium aluminum fluoride is produced from the common mineral fluorite. Sulfuric acid has a wide range of applications, including domestic acidic drain cleaner, electrolyte in lead-acid batteries, and various cleaning agents. It is also a central substance in the chemical industry. Principal uses include mineral processing, fertilizer manufacturing, oil refining, wastewater processing, and chemical synthesis. It is widely produced with different methods, such as contact process, wet sulfuric acid process and some other methods (see ""http://www.sulphuric-acid.com/sulphuric-acid-on-the-web/acid%20plants/TALCO.htm"").

This loan was intended to provide additional financing to the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project and 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. Both of these projects were supported by Export-Import Bank loans approved in 2006 (see Project ID#39984 and Project ID#39644). The terms of this PBC loan are unknown.

However, it is known that the Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between May 29, 2007 and December 21, 2028. As of December 31, 2018, $480,910 USD was outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of ""Consolidated...""). 

The purpose of the 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project was to construct a 500 kV electricity transmission line that would connect the northern Sughd region to the national grid. According to Xinhua, the project also intended to realize the effective dispatching of electricity between Dushanbe and Khujand, completely solve the problem of power shortage in the south during the dry season in winter, build the transmission channel for the implementation of the Tajik Hydropower Strategy, improve the safety, stability, and reliability of the power grid, and reduce the loss of electricity through transmission from 14% to 3.2%. 

According to Asia-Plus, the purpose of the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project was to construct a 90 km, 220 kV electricity transmission line between Dangara and Kulab. This would connect the southern region to the national grid. According to President of Tajikistan Emomali Rahmon, relayed by Asia-Plus, the new power transmission line would improve the power supply in the south of the Khatlon region, and create a more stable power supply. The Lolazor-Khatlon line had a capacity of approximately 4 billion kWh of electricity a year, according to Asia-Plus. The project was to provide the Khatlon region with electricity from the Sangtuda 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants, and allow for the export of electricity to Afghanistan.

Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for the implementation of both projects (see pg. 14 of ""China as an Emerging Donor...""). The North-South transmission line has been operational since November 29, 2009 (see pg. 11 of ""BRI in Central Asia: Energy Connectivity Projects"").  According to Asia-Plus, the Lolazor-Khatlon transmission line has been operational since June 25, 2008.

"1338",72465,"China grants 79 million RMB to Tajikistan for the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project (Linked with projects #40406, #53615)","In 2007, the Chinese Government provided RMB 79 million in grant funding to support the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel Construction Project. Previously, in July 2005, China and Tajikistan reached an agreement for providing assistance for the construction of the Shar Shar (Ozodi) Tunnel. This grant funding was not only used for direct tunnel construction but for the provision of buses,  Mobile inspection and observation complex, radiotechnics and other systems, though the specific breakdown is unknown.

China Railway No.5 Engineering Group, a subsidiary of China Railway Engineering Corporation (CREC), was the contractor responsible for project implementation. CCCC Highway Consultants Co., Ltd. undertook preliminary design of the project. Xinjiang Highway Engineering Supervision Center was responsible for supervision of construction. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on October 20, 2006. The construction was scheduled to be completed in 34 months (see ""Update: Construction of Shar-Shar tunnel in Khatlon officially begins""). The project was completed on August 8, 2009. A grand opening ceremony was held on August 30. In November 2010, the project won the China Construction Engineering Luban Prize.

The Shar-Shar Tunnel Project (alternatively: Sharshar) included a main tunnel with a total length of 2.23 km and a 4.91 km connection line (3.4 km for the northern connection line, 1.5 km for the southern connection line) and a 169-meter-long bridge in a mountainous and hilly area. This project aimed to promote general economic development. It also hoped to improve traffic conditions in Tajikistan, as well as strengthen business and logistics links between China and Tajikistan. Upon completion, the tunnel was to reportedly reduce the travel time from Dushanbe to Dangara, President Emomali Rahmon's hometown, by 40 minutes. 

This tunnel was located 80 km south of the capital city of Dushanbe, near the city of Kulyab in the Dangara District of Khatlon Region. It is on the Dushanbe-Vahdat-Dangara highway and was built under Shar-Shar mountain pass.

Later, on December 16, 2006, the Export-Import Bank of China provided a $58,228,000 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project. The loan terms carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and an interest rate of 2% (see the cited resource""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). 

The Government of Tajikistan used nearly all of the proceeds from this loan ($55,227,590, according to pg. 87 of ""Tajikistan Power Utility Financial Recovery Program"") to on-lend (through subsidiary loan agreement No. BLA06016) to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 16, 2006 and June 21, 2026. As of December 31, 2018, $520,774 USD was outstanding. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy (pg. 15 of ""Consolidated...""). 

The initial value of the project was $58.1 million USD. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $2.9 million USD to the project. Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock (TBEA) was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The project was launched in May 2006. The transmission line was planned to be commissioned by the end of December 2007, but the inclusion of the construction of an additional internal 110 kV transmission line from the Khatlon substation to the Bokhtar substation postponed the start date. The Lolazor-Khatlon transmission line was commissioned on June 25, 2008.

The purpose of this project was to construct a 90 km, 220 kV electricity transmission line between Dangara and Kulab. This would connect the southern region to the national grid. The new power transmission line would improve the power supply in the south of the Khatlon region, and create a more stable power supply. The Lolazor-Khatlon line had a capacity of approximately 4 billion kWh of electricity a year. The project was to provide the Khatlon region with electricity from the Sangtuda 1 and 2 hydroelectric power plants, and allow for the export of electricity to Afghanistan. 

The project is linked to project ID#70910, which captured a $51 million funding from Eximbank in 2009 for both the 220 kV Lolazor-Khatlon Transmission Line Project and a 500 kV North-South Power Transmission Line Project (The original financing of the 500 kV project in 2006 was captured in project ID#39644).

The ""China as an Emerging Donor..."" article indicated that China offered PBCs, Tajikistan made proposals for projects, and this project was selected. An Export-Import Bank article, although it does not explicitly name this project as a loan, states that Eximbank and Tajikistan signed preferential export buyer’s credit agreements in June 2006, close to the timeframe of the commitment of financing for this project.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls .

Ltd (CNMIM) provided a secured loan facility on commercial terms to Kryso Resources PLC — the mineral exploration and development company developing the Pakrut Gold Project — for $10 million and RMB 530 million to finance the development of the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70174 and #70319). Then, on June 19, 2014, Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited provided a $120 million term loan facility to China Nonferrous Mining Group for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70220). Then, on May 6, 2016, China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained a loan facility $120 million from CNMC International Capitals Company Limited (“CNMC”)— an associate of CNMIM — to refinance the loan facility that it contracted with Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Macau) Limited on June 19, 2014 for the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70324). On June 27, 2016 the China Nonferrous Mining Group obtained another loan, worth $19,114,809, from CNMIM for working capital purposes related to the Pakrut Gold Project (see linked Project ID#70354). Then, on July 1, 2016, China Construction Bank Corporation Macau Branch (CCBC) provided a loan facility of $100 million to China Nonferrous Mining Group to refinance its 2012 loan agreement with CNMIM (see linked Projects IDs #70367).

It was announced on October 30, 2017 that China Construction Bank Corporation Macau Branch agreed to provide China Nonferrous Gold with a loan facility of up to $20 million. The loan facility was for a maximum of one year and repayable 12 months after the first drawdown. The loan included an annual interest rate of 1.3% plus 3-month LIBOR and was governed by the law of Macau. The average 3-month LIBOR rate in October 2017 was 1.361%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 1.361+1.3=2.661%. The facility was secured by a standby letter of credit from China Construction Bank Corporation Beijing Branch, for the aggregate amount of $20,618,556.70, which expired 12 months after the date of first drawdown (1-year maturity). A standby letter of credit fee of 1.15% was payable per annum. The CCBC Loan was expected to be drawn down shortly after its signing and was to be used for working capital and to fund the restoration of production of the Pakrut gold mine (see ""Financial Update"" from October 30, 2017).

LLC Pakrut, a mine that is 100% owned by Kryso Resources Ltd, was first established in 2003 and it operates the Pakrut deposit located on the southern slope of the Gissar range, 107 km from the city of Dushanbe. The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city. It sits on the southern slope of the Gissar range. More detailed locational information can be found at http://www.cnfgold.com/Managed/Resources/docs/Downloads/srk_report.pdf.

The project reportedly reduced driving times from 12 hours to 4 hours and the Shahristan tunnel was reportedly the longest tunnel in Central Asia when it completed, according to China Global Television Network. To help repay the loan and cover the costs of maintaining the road, the Tajik Government made the highway a toll road in 2010 and allowed the private company Innovative Road Solutions to collected tolls.

"1333",43724,"China Eximbank provides $26.4 million preferential buyer’s credit for Unified Power System in Northern Tajikistan Project","On July 20, 2011, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $26,463,789 USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Tajikistan for the Unified Power System in Northern Tajikistan Project. This loan carried a 20-year maturity, a grace period of 5 to 7 years, and a 2% interest rate (see ""List of Chinese Government-Financed Projects in Tajikistan from the Ministry of Finance via the IMF May 2018""). The entire project had a cost of $27,857,000 million USD. The Government of Tajikistan contributed $1.4 million USD to the project.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend — through subsidiary loan agreement No. 2011(19) TOTAL (170) – 030 BT, dated July 20, 2011 — to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between July 20, 2011 and March 21, 2031. OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy.

According to Asia-Plus, the loan was to be used to finance the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, because the operating substation, Khujand-500, was not able to ensure regular electricity supplies to northern Tajikistan through the 550 kV South-North power transmission line (also Chinese-financed, project ID #39644 and #70910). Construction of the Sughd-500 substation was also intended to promote the implementation of the Central Asia South Asia Electricity Trade and Transmission Project (CASA 1000), which aimed to establish the necessary transmission and trading infrastructure and systems to enable a trade of surplus electricity from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan to Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Chinese company TBEA was responsible for implementation. According to Asia-Plus, the project was to begin in October 2011 and be finished by the end of the year. However, the completed project was not accepted by Tajikistan until March 15, 2013 (approved by the government on October 4, 2013) (see ""Постановление Правительства Республики Таджикистан от 4 октября 2013 года, № 444..."").

This project involved the construction of a unified power system/single power grid through the construction of a new substation, Sughd-500, in the north of Tajikistan, near Jamoat Lolazor in Devashtich District.

Additionally, in October 2011, Minister of Finance Safarali Najmiddinov said that the loan had an annual interest rate of 2.0 percent for 33 years with a seven-year grace period, as relayed by Asia-Plus. However, according to the IMF in 2018, this loan had a maturity of 20 years, a grace period from 5 to 7 years, and an annual interest rate of 2% interest rate. With all this in mind, the interest rate was coded as 2%, the maturity period was coded 20 years, and the grace period was coded as missing.","https://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/project-documents/52122/52122-001-rp-en.pdf, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devashtich_District","ADM2",69.14,39.71,"Ghonchi","District","TJK.4.4_1","Tajikistan"

According to Avesta, the loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 25 years and 1.5% interest rate per annum. The loan agreement was ratified by the Tajik parliament in December 2017.

The Government of Tajikistan used the proceeds from this PBC loan to on-lend -- through subsidiary loan agreement No. TAJ-2017-02 (BT-039), dated 29.12.2017 -- to Open Joint Stock Holding Company (OHSHC) “Barqi Tojik” at a 3% interest rate between December 29, 2017 and August 21, 2042. As of OHSHC “Barqi Tojik” was a state-owned enterprise in Tajikistan responsible for the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity and thermal energy. 

The project involved the construction of two 500 kV, high voltage power transmission lines with a length of approximately 100 km from the Rogun hydropower plant in the town of Obi Garm (within the district of Rogun) to Dushanbe. The Dushanbe-Obigarm project was designed to improve reliability and quantity of supplied energy and reduce losses in the Rasht Valley of Tajikistan, where the Nurabad, Rasht, Tajikabad, Tavildara and Lakhsh districts are located. The Dushanbe-Obi Garm 500-kV power transmission line would also help increase the export of Tajik electricity to neighboring countries. The connection between the power grids of Districts of Republican Subordination and the southern power grid would also be improved. According to the 03/29/2019 Sputnik article, the transmission lines were to pass through the territories of Faizabad, Vahdat, Rudaki and Varzob. A substation, Dushanbe-500 substation, was also to be constructed as part of the project. 

Chinese company Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA) was contracted to implement the project. In addition, according to PowerChina, Hubei Engineering Company Engineering Construction Company was involved in the project's implementation. Construction began on October 1, 2017.

The geological exploration at Pakrut deposit started in 2004. The pre-gold reserves at the deposit, approved by the State Reserves Committee (CRC) of the Republic of Tajikistan, were 28.1 tons. The reserves of Pakrut gold mine are currently estimated to be 100 tons. In November 2011, the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan issued a mining licence to LLC Pakrut. Construction started in September 2012. The project went into production on June 5, 2016. In February 2017, high levels of snowfall caused significant damage to the facilities and equipment, and interrupted the construction, which was restarted in the second half of 2017. All construction work was expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2018 and production was expected to be recommenced in April 2018.

This mining project is located in Vahdat District, Republic of Tajikistan, about 80 km northeast (“NE”) in a straight line (112 km by road) from Dushanbe, the country’s capital city.

On June 27, 2009, the Chinese Government committed RMB 60 million to the Government of Uzbekistan through an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ECTA). Using RMB 50 million of the proceeds from this ECTA, the Government of Uzbekistan obtained an interest-free loan for the Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project. To support this loan agreement, an inter-bank agreement was signed between China Development Bank and the National Bank for Foreign Economic Affairs of the Republic of Uzbekistan on May 28, 2010. 

The Karakul Pumping Station Reconstruction Project sought to reconstruct a Karakul district pumping station in Bukhara region (oblast). It did so by, among other things, facilitating the acquisition of pump equipment. China IPPR International Engineering Corporation was the contractor. This pump station is responsible for the irrigation of nearly 30,000 hectares of land in the Karakul region and the water supply for 769 livestock farms. During the slack season, the pump station is used to wash saline-alkali soil. The primary and auxiliary Karakul pump stations have been operating for over 40 years and 25 years, respectively, and long exceeded the normal service life of mechanical and electrical equipment. The poorly serviced equipment were no longer able to satisfy the local irrigation needs. The successful completion and operation of the Karakul Pump Station Reconstruction Project on schedule further expanded the irrigation coverage of the pump station, not only restoring and improving the agricultural irrigation and drainage conditions, but also effectively improving the salinealkali soil environment. The Karakul region, one of the most important cotton production areas of Uzbekistan, had an excellent harvest of cotton in that very year. In 2012, both the region’s irrigated cotton plantation area and output ranked second across the country and the cotton festival, which had been abandoned for over a decade, was revived, attracting over 200,000 visitors.  

This project was initiated in 2006 and completed on January 13, 2013.

The project is funded by a $177.7 million USD loan agreement with the Bank of China, under the guarantee of CNPC. The total cost of the project is $377.5 million USD.

The Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC) and Uzbekneftegaz began developing three gas condensate fields in the Bukhara-Khiva region of Uzbekistan (Dengizkul, Kojadavlat, and Sharky Alat). When the three fields are developed, they will produce 869.6 million cubic meters of natural gas for exportation and 6,400 tons of gas condensate for domestic markets annually. The project was scheduled to begin in 2014, but construction began on May 30th, 2017.

The project will be implemented by three CNPC subsidiary companies: China Petroleum Engineering & Construction Corporation (CPECC) will develop the fields, designs, logistics, construction, and commissioning of facilities for the project; XIBU Drilling Engineering Company Ltd. will drill 10 production wells; and China National Logging Corporation will repair 6 wells and test production wells. 

In December 2017, the New Silk Road Oil and Gas Company Ltd (NSROG) founded as a joint venture by the CNPC and Uzbekneftegaz to oversee the project, started gas production in the Dengizkul field after the drilling of 2 new wells and repairing of 3 wells. NSROG announced that the Kojadavlat and Sharky Alat, specifically the 8 new wells and 3 damaged wells within these fields, were still under construction. A projected end date for the project has not been announced; however, construction was still occurring in September 2018.

Leading up to the 2017 development of these fields, the China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development (CNODC), a subsidiary of CNPC, conducted a 5 year geologic oil survey for 359 million USD in 2006 (#54069), drilled 13 exploratory wells worth 260.2 million USD in 2011 (#39659), and 14.9 million USD for further oil exploration in 2012 (#39658).
