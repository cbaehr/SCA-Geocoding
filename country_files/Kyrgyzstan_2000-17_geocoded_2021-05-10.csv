40336,"China Eximbank provides $70 million preferential buyer's credit for the South Kyrgyz Cement Factory Construction Project in Kyzyl-Kiya City","In 2006 China Eximbank provided a $70 million preferential buyer's credit (PBC) loan to BTA Bank for the construction of the South Kyrgyz Cement Factory in Kyzyl-Kiya City. Turan-Alem Bank (or BTA Bank) used the proceeds of this loan to on-lend to the project company (South Kyrgyz Cement CJSC) responsible for the construction of the cement factory. This loan was also guaranteed by BTA Bank. This project officially broke ground on March 25, 2006, with China CAMC Engineering Co Ltd implementing the project (as the EPC contractor) in partnership with South Kyrgyz Cement CJSC. The plant was expected to have an output of 2500 tons of cement per day and it was slated for completion in 2008. The cement production line was successfully put into operation in September 2009. The plant was officially commissioned on July 12, 2009. Although there was turmoil in the country including riots near the factory, a technical team successfully completed the performance evaluation of the production line and handed over the factory to the owner for management. STAFF_NOTE: This project is the first Chinese government provided a preferential credit within the framework of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO). Some sources indicate that the face value of the loan was $77.8 million. However, for the time being, we use the more conservative $70 million estimate from BTA Bank, which is the guarantor of the loan.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=XIFICB0020060612e26c000gq&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=AFXASI0020060612e26c002pb&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.camce.com.cn/cn/xwzx/gsxw/201503/t20150309_56433.htm, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://finance.sina.com.cn/money/bank/bank_hydt/20060616/00002655819.shtml, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://finance.people.com.cn/GB/1038/4460848.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LBA0000020070827e38r000ih&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/zrj0yfnwejus6nv/JICA%20Presenta, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); http://bta.kz/en/press/news/2007/08/24/219/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://bta.kz/en/press/news/2007/08/24/219/ and https://books.google.com/books?id=s1ElDgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96&lpg=PT96&dq=China+eximbank+%22cement%22+%22tajikistan%22&source=bl&ots=elf6VPJwRI&sig=wSRtefjW7G_Zwp-M340zn7daYRg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjF4b2d77bfAhWIEXwKHUb-AwE4ChDoATACegQICBAB#v=onepage&q=China%20eximbank%20%22cement%22%20%22tajikistan%22&f=false, Academic Journal Article; https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ifrichinacentralasiakassenovaengjanuary2008.pdf, Academic Journal Article; https://books.google.com/books?id=J4kYDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA124&lpg=PA124&dq=kyrgyz+china+cement+factory+loan+2006&source=bl&ots=xp0ce0XZhp&sig=ACfU3U2NFQeBZloqHbhWtH9Brl9ZTadO6Q&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjJzNyM-pDhAhXEq1kKHeM-DOAQ6AEwAHoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=kyrgyz%20china%20cement%20factory%20loan%202006&f=false, Academic Journal Article; http://www.ctiec.net/news/medium_news/40.jsp, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.camce.com.cn/cn/xwzx/gsxw/201503/t20150309_56429.htm, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m80lqtkxyl6sxx/BTA%20Bank%20-%20News.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://english.eximbank.gov.cn/News/NewsR/201810/t20181024_7602.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.camce.com.cn/en/enAC/enHOD/en2009/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.camce.com.cn/en/enAC/enHOD/en2006/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.camce.com.cn/en/enBA/enEC/enIP/201503/t20150310_57521.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=XIFICB0020060612e26c000gq&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=AFXASI0020060612e26c002pb&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=LBA0000020070827e38r000ih&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Kyzyl-Kiya,+Kyrgyzstan/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x38bc7653c790e3f1:0xf20d8ffcea28a48a?sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwj85drs6bXvAhUsGVkFHVHYAFsQ8gEwE3oECBgQAQ, https://www.google.com/maps/place/CJSC+Yuzhno-Kyrgyzskiy+Cement/@40.2508212,72.1575025,13.26z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0x22008c1573beccab!8m2!3d40.2570438!4d72.1914679","Kadamjai division is coded for this project since the cement factory that was built was build in Kyzyl-Kiya which is located in this division.

This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. 

The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. Construction began on May 2, 2014. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. 

This project has also been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site. 

Staff Note: The Alternative North-South Road Project (Russian: строительства альтернативной дороги Север—Юг; Chinese: “北-南公路”) is being implemented in three parts and financed with 3 different China Eximbank loans: Phase 1 of the project [Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486)] is being financed with a $399,989,041 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID# 40491).

(2015) 4 TOTAL NO. (346)] for the construction of the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. This project is also known as Phase 2 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 2”). The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.18% commitment fee. 

The proceeds from the loan were used to support a May 4, 2014 commercial contract [EXMB/KG/NS-05] between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. This road section runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km). More locational details can be found within the sources ""Kyrgyzstan and the Belt and Road Initiative,"" ""Static Akipress,"" ""Alternative North-South Road Aral - Kazarman (Construction)"", ""Министерство транспорта и дорог Кыргызской Республики,"" and ""Financing the Construction of an Alternative North-South Road in Kyrgyzstan."" Construction began on August 10, 2015. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. It was scheduled for completion on April 10, 2020. 

This project has also been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.   

Staff Note: The Alternative North-South Road Project (Russian: строительства альтернативной дороги Север—Юг; Chinese: “北-南公路”) is being implemented in three parts and financed with 3 different China Eximbank loans: Phase 1 of the project [Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486)] is being financed with a $399,989,041 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID# 40491). Phase 2 of the project [the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km)] is being financed with a RMB 697,562,608.76 government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank (Project ID#46350) and a 185,254,119 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID#53585). Phase 3 of the project [the Balykchy-Kyzyl-Zhyldyz Section (0-183km) was funded by the Asian Development Bank.","Transport and Storage","http://www.azernews.az/region/83790.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/zrj0yfnwejus6nv/JICA%20Presenta, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://uc0ec6f1e906aba9316ff3b6eb35.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyppxwt8jkgjf4bm%2FChina%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Silk%2520Road%2520Economic%2520Belt%2520Initiative-%2520Network%2520and%2520Influence%2520Formation%2520in%2520Central%2520Asia%2520.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26, Academic Journal Article; https://uc40ecda589681de6d814fb4ef62.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fsh%2Fcsm96s09710qee6%2FAAACGhIk-jgmQTb2u5MBx5Sda%2F2015%2520China%2520Eximbank%2520Export%2520Credit%2520for%2520ALTERNATIVE%2520NORTH-SOUTH%2520ROAD%2520PROJECT%252C%2520SECTION%2520ARAL-KAZARMAN%2520(KM195-KM291)%2520in%2520Kyrgyz%2520Republic.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kg.mofcom.gov.cn/article/zxhz/201505/20150500979348.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/1q67pueoowul7vp/2015%20China%20Eximbank%20Export%20Credit%20for%20ALTERNATIVE%20NORTH-SOUTH%20ROAD%20PROJECT%2C%20SECTION%20ARAL-KAZARMAN%20%28KM195-KM291%29%20in%20Kyrgyz%20Republic.pdf?dl=0 , Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/dl/gbdqzn/upload/jierjisi.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.eximbank.gov.cn/aboutExim/annals/2013/201807/P020180712358276153727.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.uca.int/Content/Downloads/UCA-IPPA-WP50_Kyrgyzstan%20and%20Belt%20Road%20Initiative_ENG.pdf, Academic Journal Article; http://static.akipress.org/127/.storage/business/images/Nazika/0d0de3348ed67b9e5d654d234f3a92b0.png, Other; https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/alternative-north-south-road-aral-kazarman-construction/f1087d65-1476-48a0-a27a-76feda4e2687/, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/Kyrgyzstan_8.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://stanradar.com/news/full/10085-karta-finansirovanie-stroitelstva-alternativnoj-dorogi-severjug-v-kyrgyzstane.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.kenesh.kg/ru/committee/article/6/2351/show/r-e-sh-e-n-i-e-komiteta-zhogorku-kenesha-kirgizskoy-respubliki-po-transportu-kommunikatsiyam-arhitekture-i-stroitelystvu-ot-26-fevralya-2019-goda-o-sostoyanii-avtomobilynih-dorog-respubliki-podvedomstvennih-ministerstvu-transporta-i-dorog-kirgizskoy-respubliki-i-hode-realizatsii-ratifitsirovannih-zakonov-po-rekonstruktsii-i-stroitelystvu-avtomobilynih-dorog, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.xinhuanet.com/world/2019-06/11/c_1124609100.htm, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.carecprogram.org/uploads/KGZ_EN.pdf, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.dropbox.com/s/1q67pueoowul7vp/2015%20China%20Eximbank%20Export%20Credit%20for%20ALTERNATIVE%20NORTH-SOUTH%20ROAD%20PROJECT%2C%20SECTION%20ARAL-KAZARMAN%20%28KM195-KM291%29%20in%20Kyrgyz%20Republic.pdf?dl=0, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.crbc.com/site/crbcEN/514/info/2017/46841299.html?id=570e2bf6-b830-4fd4-80d9-1c51e2336193, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/odr/kyrgyzstans-north-south-road-to-corruption/, NGO/Civil Society/Advocacy; https://www.fergananews.com/articles/10031, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9Cf8PFArVg, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://slovo.kg/?p=43621%20and%20https://24.kg/english/56183_Second_phase_of_North-South_road_construction_to_end_in_2020/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://kg.china-embassy.org/rus/ggwj/t1790707.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/ha/default.aspx#./!?&_suid=159648440072607873048431312641, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/ha/default.aspx#./!?&_suid=1596554074386016081314320322337, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/ha/default.aspx#./!?&_suid=159648440072607873048431312641, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/ha/default.aspx#./!?&_suid=1596554074386016081314320322337, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://reconnectingasia.csis.org/database/projects/alternative-north-south-road-aral-kazarman-construction/f1087d65-1476-48a0-a27a-76feda4e2687/","The road runs from Kazarman to Aral.

The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. This road section runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km). More locational details can be found within the sources ""Kyrgyzstan and the Belt and Road Initiative,"" ""Static.AkiPress,"" ""Alternative North-South Road Aral - Kazarman (Construction),"" ""Financing the Construction of an Alternative North-South Road in Kyrgyzstan"" and ""Министерство транспорта и дорог Кыргызской Республики."" Construction began on August 10, 2015. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. It was scheduled for completion on April 10, 2020. 

This project has been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.

This agreement facilitated the Rehabilitation of the 50 km Osh-Sarytash-Irkeshtam Road Construction Project (190 km to 240 km Section) as well as the the development of the Ishtamberdy gold field. The agreement included a China Development Bank loan of $25.3 million. 

A Chinese company called Full Gold Mining LLC was the entity responsible for project implementation. The proceeds from a gold mining investment by Full Gold Mining Limited Liability Company (LLC) in Ishtamberdy were to be used to repay the CDB loan. Full Gold Mining Limited Liability Company (LLC) is a subsidiary of Lingbao Gold Company Limited, which is a Chinese state-owned mining company. This road was completed and opened for use on November 22, 2012. The Asian Development Bank later conducted an impact evaluation of the Osh-Sarytash-Irkeshtam Road Construction Project and the Sarytash–Karamyk Road Construction Project found that they ""had a positive effect on poverty reduction and retail trade growth, which was especially evident in the sample of two mountainous districts.""

By the end of 2015, China Development Bank had disbursed $300 million to China Petrol Company Junda LLC through this framework agreement. 

China Petrol Company Junda LLC is a project company established to manage the financing, design, and implementation of the Kara-Balta Oil Refinery Project (also known as the Zhongda Oil Refinery Project in Kara-Balta). China Petrol Company Junda LLC is owned by Central Asia Energy Co., Ltd, which in turn is owned by Shaanxi Dade Investment Group Co., Ltd and Shaanxi Coal and Chemical Industry Group (a Chinese state-owned enterprise). 

Kara-Balta Oil Refinery Project was initiated on September 9, 2013. The refinery produced its first barrel of oil was produced in January 2014. The refinery was officially put into operation on January 1, 2017.  It processes crude oil that is imported by rail from Russia and Kazakhstan, as well as a small amount from Kyrgyzstan itself. The refinery paid the Kyrgyz government $43 million U.S. dollars in 2018, making it the country's second-largest taxpayer. It is also one of the nation's largest employers, hiring over 2,000 locals. 

However, the project has also been plagued by controversy. It was forced to suspend operations in 2015 temporarily after local demonstrations against pollution. Activists in Kara-Balta said residents living close to the refinery were not able to open their windows due to a heavy thick industrial smell and pollution. The plant resumed production in 2016. 

This oil refinery is located in Kara-Balta. Its exact locational coordinates are available at https://www.google.com/maps/place/Neftepererabatyvayushchiy+Zavod+%22Dzhunda%22/@42.7939521,73.8803959,15z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x0:0xb66bf4c6f3e76781!8m2!3d42.7952117!4d73.8900948.”

(2015) 9 TOTAL NO. 548] for the construction of the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km) of the Alternative North-South Road Project. This project is also known as Phase 2 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 2”). The loan carried the following terms: 25 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 1.5% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.18% commitment fee. 

The proceeds from the loan were used to support a May 4, 2014 commercial contract [EXMB/KG/NS-05] between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. This road section runs from Aral to Kazarman (195 km to 291 km). More locational details can be found within the sources ""Kyrgyzstan and the Belt and Road Initiative,"" ""Static.AkiPress,"" ""Alternative North-South Road Aral - Kazarman (Construction),"" ""Financing the Construction of an Alternative North-South Road in Kyrgyzstan"" and ""Министерство транспорта и дорог Кыргызской Республики."" Construction began on August 10, 2015. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. It was scheduled for completion on April 10, 2020. 

This project has been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.

This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. 

The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. Construction began on May 2, 2014. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. 

This project has also been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site.

Phase 3 of the project [the Balykchy-Kyzyl-Zhyldyz Section (0-183km) was funded by the Asian Development Bank.

39620,"China Eximbank provides $386 million preferential buyer’s credit for Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project","On September 11, 2013, China Eximbank and the Government of Kyrgyz Republic’s Ministry of Finance signed a preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement [CHINA EXIMBANK PBC NO. (2013) 38 TOTAL NO. (282)] for the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant Modernization Project. The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.25% commitment fee, and 0.18% management fee.  

The proceeds from this loan were to be used to finance a commercial contract (number D-166-21/322) between the Joint Stock Company (JSC) “Electric Power Plants of Kyrgyzstan” and Tebian Electric Apparatus Stock Co., Ltd. (TBEA). This project sought to install two turbines (units 12 and 13) with a capacity of 150 megawatts at the Bishkek Thermal Power Plant (TPP). As a result, the capacity of Bishkek TPP was expected to increase by 125 megawatts. Prior to project completion, the annual output of electricity at the TPP was one billion kWh. After its modernization through the China Eximbank-financed project, the production of the TPP was expected to reach 1.8 billion kWh. Heat production was also expected to increase from two million gigacalories to three million gigacalories per year.  The project began implementation on April 26, 2014 and it was successfully completed on August 30, 2017. 

However, this project was plagued by controversy. The project was completed and put into production at the end of August 2017, but major failures occurred within less than 5 months of operation, and some boilers collapsed, causing power outages and stopping heating. In 2015, the Chamber of Audits, a state body tasked with overseeing government spending, issued a report questioning why the TBEA contract was not put out to tender when other companies were interested in bidding. Auditors also found that no technical feasibility study was undertaken to evaluate the needs and costs of the project. Nurlan Omurkul, who was chief of the Bishkek TPP, said that he had harbored strong doubts about hiring a company with no track record of building power stations, but that he had been badgered by senior Kyrgyz officials to endorse a decision that he said had obviously already been made. He told the New York Times that “I’ve worked my whole life in power and heating plants and knew all along that the Chinese price of $386 million was too expensive.” Another Chinese company, China Machinery Engineering Corporation, offered a lower bid, $356 million, according to a parliamentary commission. But the Chinese Embassy reportedly insisted that its offer be dismissed. Eventually, the country’s former Prime Minister (Jantoro Satybaldiev), former mayor of Bishkek (Kubanychbek Kulmatov), and former Energy Minister (Osmonbek Artykbaev) were arrested on corruption charges and accused of using their positions to lobby for the interests of a Chinese company (TBEA) in the selection process of the contractor for the project. Prosecutors in the case claimed that rigged bidding and inflated pricing would cost the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic as much as $111,252,797.

71092,"China Eximbank provides RMB 100 million loan for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Factory Project (Linked to project ID#40305)","On April 12, 2001, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a Governmental Concessional Loan Agreement (GCL) with the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic (see ""The Supplemental agreement on the Government concessional loan agreement on the paper mill project (July 11, 2003)""). In the loan, China Eximbank agreed to loan the Government of the Kyrgyz Republic RMB 100 million for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Factory Project. This loan carried the following terms: an interest rate of 3% and a maturity period of 15 years (see slide 16 of JICA's ""China’s Foreign Aid: Current Status and Future Challenges"").

The paper mill itself was the product of a joint Sino-Kyrgyz venture. The plans for the paper mill began in the 1990s with agreements between China and Kyrgyzstan. Construction reportedly began in August 2000 (see pg.18, 27 of ""China as an Emerging Donor in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan""). It was completed at the end of August 2002. After it went into production, it experienced a series of disturbances, investigations, and inspections, to the detriment of normal operations. The factory, located in Tokmok, went bankrupt within three years. There had been serious financial wrongdoings and violations of the migration regime by the plant's Chinese employees.

This loan was first restructured in 2003. This refinancing is recorded in Project ID#40305. The maturity date (June 6, 2017) and the interest rate (3%) were left unchanged, but the lender China Eximbank waived the requirement that the Ministry of Finance of the Kyrgyz Republic make principal and interest repayments until September 20, 2007. This amendment effectively represented the provision of a grace period of 4.25 years (see ""The Supplemental agreement on the Government concessional loan agreement on the paper mill project (July 11, 2003)""). 

In December 2014, this second-time refinancing for the loan was under discussion. Kyrgyzstan announced that it owed a debt of approximately 9.8 million U.S. dollars to the Export-Import Bank of China on the construction project of the paper factory. Prior to the second restructuring, the Kyrgyz authorities had repeatedly requested that China Eximbank convert the loan into a grant (i.e. write off their oustanding debt obligations for the Kyrgyz-Chinese Paper Mill Project), but China Eximbank declined. Both sides agreed to reschedule the loan a second time and signed another amendment to the loan agreement to codify the terms of the second rescheduling. 

On March 16, 2015, Kyrgyzstan announced that the paper factory has gone through bankruptcy procedures and is evaluating its assets to sell for debt repayment. According to the results of negotiations between the Ministry of Finance of Kyrgyzstan and China at the end of 2014, the debt of RMB 60.2 million will be repaid in five installments before June 20, 2017, with an annual interest rate of 2% during the period.

(2001) 9 (82) (see ""The Supplemental agreement on the Government concessional loan agreement on the paper mill project (July 11, 2003)""). According to the TUFF methodology, only one refinancing was recorded as an individual project. The second refinancing was recorded in this description.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://www.jica.go.jp/jica-ri/publication/other/l75nbg00000x54vi-att/other_20181005_EN.pdf, Academic Journal Article; https://online.zakon.kz/Document/?doc_id=30453301#pos=14;-59, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kg.mofcom.gov.cn/sys/print.shtml?/ztdy/200310/20031000139385, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kg.mofcom.gov.cn/article/ztdy/200309/20030900131490.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kg.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201503/20150300913195.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://kg.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201503/20150300913195.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://www.ifri.org/sites/default/files/atoms/files/ifrichinacentralasiakassenovaengjanuary2008.pdf, Academic Journal Article",NA,"https://www.google.com/maps/place/Tokmok,+Kyrgyzstan/@42.8168683,75.259003,13z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x389bf59a31a24119:0xb84831fb5ca4a513!8m2!3d42.8257618!4d75.2901807","The paper factory is located in Tokmok, a city that is in the Chuy region.

This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. 

The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. Construction began on May 2, 2014. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. 

This project has also been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site. 

Staff Note: The Alternative North-South Road Project (Russian: строительства альтернативной дороги Север—Юг; Chinese: “北-南公路”) is being implemented in three parts and financed with 3 different China Eximbank loans: Phase 1 of the project [Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486)] is being financed with a $399,989,041 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID# 40491). Phase 2 of the project [the Aral-Kazarman Section (195 km-291 km)] is being financed with a RMB 697,562,608.76 government concessional loan (GCL) from China Eximbank (Project ID#46350) and a 185,254,119 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID#53585). Phase 3 of the project [the Balykchy-Kyzyl-Zhyldyz Section (0-183km) was funded by the Asian Development Bank. Since Project ID#40491 is an export buyer’s credit provided on concessional terms, it is coded as having mixed intent.","Transport and Storage","https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&NS=16&AID=9VIV000400&an=MENREP0020140104e9c900fc5&cat=a&ep=ASI, Media Report, including Wikileaks;

This project is also known as Phase 1 of the Alternative North-South Road Project (or “Строительство альтернативной автомобильной дороги Север-Юг, фаза 1”). The loan carried the following terms: 20 year maturity, 11 year grace period, 2% interest rate, 0.18% management fee, and 0.25% commitment fee. The proceeds from the loan were used to support a July 8, 2013 commercial contract between the Ministry of Transport and Communications of the Kyrgyz Republic and China Road and Bridge Corporation. 

The aim of this international North-South transport corridor is to reduce trade costs and connect Russia, Central Asia, Iran, and India. Construction began on May 2, 2014. As of 2019, this project was still implementation. 

This project has also been plagued by controversy. According to a 2018 investigation, former Minister of Transport and Communications Kalykbek Sultanov and the Minister of Transport and Communications at the time (Zhamshitbek Kalilov) may have colluded with the contractor responsible for project implementation (CRBC) to embezzle funds that were allocated for the Alternative North-South Road by China Eximbank. The investigation found the project input costs were inflated by several orders of magnitude — from paying $1.1 per kilogram of cement (while the cost on the local market was $0.07) to paying $2,000 a month to provide office space to an engineer on the construction site. 

Staff Note: The Alternative North-South Road Project (Russian: строительства альтернативной дороги Север—Юг; Chinese: “北-南公路”) is being implemented in three parts and financed with 3 different China Eximbank loans: Phase 1 of the project [Kazarman-Jalal Abad Section (km291-km433) and Balykchy-Aral Section (km183+500-195+486)] is being financed with a $399,989,041 PBC from China Eximbank (Project ID# 40491).

This loan was intended to be used for the Bishkek Osh-Batken Fiber Optic Network Construction Project. The loan carried the following terms: a 5-year maturity, a grace period of 0.5 years, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 2.5% margin (see pg.18 of ""KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2015"").

This project is linked to a $8.7 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in September 2009 for this project (see linked project ID#70878), a $4.9 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in February 2011 for this project (see linked project ID#70881), a $4 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in June 2011 (see linked project ID#70884), and a $2.2 million CDB loan to KyrgyzTelecom in October 2012 (see linked project ID#70889).

The agreement included an extradition clause as well as a Chinese pledge to expand infrastructure in the Kyrgyz Republic. Such projects included reconstruction of China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Highway, construction of a railway under ODANAEA project, and creating a network of Silk Road transportation. To facilitate such projects, China granted the Kyrgyz Republic 60 million RMB. The China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Highway starts from Kashgar, Xinjiang, China in the east, passes through the China-Kyrgyzstan port, passes through the south of Kyrgyzstan, and ends in Tashkent, Uzbekistan in the west. The funds needed to repair 258 kilometers of roads in Kyrgyzstan were solved in three ways: one was to use China's 60 million yuan free assistance to repair the 17.74 kilometers of roads (captured in project ID#40315, completed); the second was to use ADB and Islamic Development Bank loans to repair 121 kilometers (ADB loans to 77-kilometer section construction and the Islamic Development Bank loans to 44-kilometer section construction); the third is to repair the remaining sections through the Sino-Kyrgyzstan 'resource for project' cooperation model. On March 13, 2007, China Road and Bridge Engineering Co., Ltd., and Kyrgyzstan Minister of Transport and Communications Suleymanov signed the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan Highway construction contract. The contract value is 27 million US dollars. The length of the section is 77 kilometers (Osh-Quelcea) and the construction period is 36 months. In order to initiate the ADB loan, the Kyrgyz side needs to contribute US$4 million in matching funds.

70874,"CDB provides $3.5 million loan for Digital Horizon Transformation Project (Linked to Project ID#70873)","On November 12, 2007, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $3,500,000 loan agreement with KyrgyzTelecom. This loan was intended to be used for the Digital Horizon Transformation Project. The loan carried the following terms: a 6-year maturity period (the exact maturity date was December 12, 2013), a grace period of 1.5 years, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 1.8% margin. The loan was repaid before December 31, 2015 (see pg.15 of ""KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2015"").

Huawei Technologies provided related equipment for the project. Digital Horizon Transformation Project sought to upgrade the fixed network of KyrgyzTelecom from an analog network to a digital network (see ""国家开发银行融资支持吉电信改造项目""). It provided for the parallel implementation of two projects: the modernization and development of the Bishkek telecommunication network and modernization and development of the regional telecommunication networks. It included the introduction of the expansion BGTS networks and an increase in KyrgyzTelecom's subscriber lines capacity to 250,000 (see ""KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2006"").

This project is linked to a $6.6 million loan from CDB for Digital Horizon Transformation Project in June 2006 (see linked project ID#70873).

STAFF_NOTE:  The interest rate of 6-month LIBOR in 2007 was 4.832%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 4.832% + 1.8%, or 6.632%. The Russian project title is Телекоммуникационный проект «Цифровое будущее». 

Only $3,340,054.6 was actually received. This may be due to losses from the exchange rate difference, which was KGS 1,370,758.40.

According to the KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2007, the $3.5 million loan signed on November 12, 2007 had the following terms: a 9-year maturity period, a grace period of 1 year and 1 month, and an interest rate of LIBOR + 1.8%. The KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2008 provides a 9-year maturity period, a grace period of 1 year and 1 month, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 1.8%. However, the KyrgyzTelecom Financial Report 2009 provides a 6-year maturity period, a grace period of 1.5 years, and an interest rate of 6 month LIBOR + 1.8%.
