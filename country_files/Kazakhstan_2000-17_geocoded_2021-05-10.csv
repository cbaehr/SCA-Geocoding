40265,"Bank of China provides a $232 million USD loan for the Bitumen (Asphalt) Plant Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#55030 and #73404)","On September 28, 2010, the Bank of China (BOC) signed a $232 million USD loan agreement for the construction of a bitumen (asphalt) plant in Aktau (see ""Bank of China to provide $232 ml loan to finance construction of an asphalt plant in Aktau""). The loan carried a maturity period of seven years, and JV Caspi Bitum LLP pledged the plant as a guarantee for the loan. JV Caspi Bitum LLP was a project company (special purpose vehicle) that established in October 2009 to assume responsible for the financing, design, and implementation of the Bitumen Asphalt Plant Construction Project. Its owners were Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries JSC (KPI) (50%), a subsidiary of KazMunay Gas, and CITIC Kazakhstan LLP (50%), a subsidiary of CITIC Group (see ""НЕФТЬ""). The proceeds of the BOC loan were meant to cover 80% of the cost of the bitumen (asphalt) plant (see ""National Company KazMunayGas (Kazakhstan) informed about signing Loan Agreement...""). The total cost of the project was $290 million USD; KPI and CITIC Kazakhstan each contributed the remaining 10% ($29 million USD) (see pg.73 of ""KMG Annual Report 2010""). For CITIC Kazakhstan's contribution, see linked project ID#73404.

This bitumen asphalt plant was located in the city of Aktau, at the former Aktau Plastics Plant in the Mangystau Region. The project sought to construct a plant enable to produce high quality road bitumen in order to satisfy the Kazakhstan's requirements for road construction. The plant was expected to produce 406,500 tons of road bitumen, 225,400 tons of petrol-diesel fraction, and 330,300 tons of vacuum gas oil per year (see pg.35 of ""KMG Annual Report 2011""). The plant was planned to use up to 1 million tons of oil per year from the Mangystau Karazhanbas as feedstock. The plant was also intended to reduce Kazakhstan's reliance on Russian bitumen imports (see ""НЕФТЬ""). JSC OGCC KazStroyService and CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. were contractors responsible for project implementation (see ""Bank of China to provide $232 ml loan to finance construction of an asphalt plant in Aktau"")

Work on the project was expected to be completed in December 2012 (see pg.35 of ""KMG Annual Report 2011""). Construction was launched on June 9, 2010 (see ""Kazakh President launches construction of Aktau bitumen plant""). However, the official commissioning of the plant took place on December 12, 2013 (pg.35 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project completion ceremony was held on December 20, 2013 (see ""Ambassador to Kazakhstan Le Yucheng Attends the Commissioning Ceremony..."").

This loan was refinanced by BOC in June 2016, as captured by linked project ID#55030.","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020100929e69t0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZWIR0020100929e69s000xe&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://kz.chineseembassy.org/rus/zhgx/t710297.htm, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20150927042204/https://kazakhembus.com/content/kazakh-president-visits-china-deals-worth-23-billion-signed, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://investkz.com/en/journals/76/619.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://web.archive.org/web/20150421010237/https://www.kmg.kz/upload/corporate_management/equity/2013/god2013eng.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://astanatimes.com/2014/01/bitumen-plant-commissioned-aktau-creating-another-link-china-kazakhstan/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://uc1bf25c866be68e5ee73a595e25.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fgvxafjn32lses2g%2F2013%2520Bond%2520Prospects%2520for%2520Kazakhstan%2520State-Owned%2520Gas%2520Company.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://astanatimes.com/2014/01/bitumen-plant-commissioned-aktau-creating-another-link-china-kazakhstan/, Media Report, including Wikileaks; http://www.kmg.kz/uploads/documents/reports/2010/eng/Godovoi_otchet_za_2010_god_en.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.caspibitum.kz/%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F/?lang=en, Other; http://whykmg.com/storage/files/71abca6dfe5c49fa/annual_report-ENG-s_obl2011.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://panoramakz.com/index.php/economics/oil/item/27997-, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://en.trend.az/business/energy/1757986.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.inform.kz/en/kazakh-president-launches-construction-of-aktau-bitumen-plant_a2276592, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://kase.kz/files/emitters/KMGZ/kmgzp_2019_eng.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://construction.citic/en/content/details_47_2382.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://kase.kz/en/news/show/1117136/, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.fmprc.gov.cn/mfa_eng/wjb_663304/zwjg_665342/zwbd_665378/t1114299.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://uc1bf25c866be68e5ee73a595e25.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fgvxafjn32lses2g%2F2013%2520Bond%2520Prospects%2520for%2520Kazakhstan%2520State-Owned%2520Gas%2520Company.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://uc1bf25c866be68e5ee73a595e25.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fgvxafjn32lses2g%2F2013%2520Bond%2520Prospects%2520for%2520Kazakhstan%2520State-Owned%2520Gas%2520Company.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://uc1bf25c866be68e5ee73a595e25.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fgvxafjn32lses2g%2F2013%2520Bond%2520Prospects%2520for%2520Kazakhstan%2520State-Owned%2520Gas%2520Company.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1 , Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020100929e69t0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZWIR0020100929e69s000xe&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.google.com/maps/place/Aktau,+Kazakhstan/@43.6593996,51.1057797,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x41b4321732bc75d7:0x7614e1e6630a7769!8m2!3d43.6588079!4d51.1974563","Aktau district is coded for this project (note that the GADM layer has a different spelling - Aqtau).

53553,"China Development Bank provides a $2 billion USD loan for the Atyrau Petrochemical Complex Construction Project (Linked to Project ID#40266)","In 2009, Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries (KPI) LLP signed an Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) contract with Sinopec Engineering Co., Ltd. (through Sinopec Group subsidiary China Petroleum & Chemical Corporation) for the first stage of construction of Atyrau petrochemical project (see ""哈萨克斯坦石油加工领域发展和炼厂改造情况"" and ""Sinopec to build gas chemicals plant in Kazakhstan""). On February 22, 2011, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $1.4 billion USD credit agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China to finance the construction of an integrated petrochemical project in the Atyrau Region of Kazakstan. However, as of 2017, no amounts had been drawn down under this credit agreement (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017""). This was due to the mutual termination of the EPC contract between KPI and Sinopec in 2014 (see ""Polypropylene plant will be built by the Chinese, but not by Sinopec Engineering""). Therefore, AidData has assumed that the China Eximbank loan was cancelled (since the proceeds of this loan were to be used to fund the EPC contract with Sinopec). For this cancelled loan, see linked project ID#40266.

Then on, December 2015, China National Chemical Engineering Corporation (CNCEC) signed a contract to construct an integrated gas-chemical complex in the Atyrau Region on a turnkey basis (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau...""). Then, on September 3, 2016, China Development Bank (Xinjiang Branch) (CDB) signed a $2 billion USD loan agreement with KPI for the construction of the complex (see ""Atyrau Petrochemical Complex""). The loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 5.8%. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided a guarantee for this loan on February 13, 2017. On November 24, 2017, CDB sent an advance payment of $409 million USD to CNCEC (see ""Technopark phase""). The project had a total cost of $2.6 billion USD; the CDB bank covered the entire cost of the $1.795 billion USD EPC contract with CNCEC; the remainder of the financing of the project was provide by its organizers of the project; KPI and its ownership (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau..."").

KPI was the project company (special purpose vehicle) responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Atyrau Petrochemical Complex Construction Project. KPI was 99% owned by United Chemical Company LLP, a subsidiary of JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna; the remaining 1% of KPI LLP was owned by a private investor, ""Firm Almex Plus” LLP (see ""About company""). Almex reportedly had a 49% ownership in November 2017, but this was either incorrect, or an indication that it sold the majority of its shares to United Chemical Company LLP (see ""Kazakhstan intends to continue construction of PP production in Atyrau..."").

42 construction and installation companies were involved in the construction and installation work; 39 of which were Kazakhstani and 3 of which were foreign. The Kazakhstani companies included AtyrauNefteMash LLP, which produced the propane and propylene splitter, ""Petropavlovsk Plant of Heavy Machine Building"" JSC and Sewon-Vertex Heavy Industries received orders for the production of 35 units and heat exchangers with a total weight  (see ""Қазақстандық компаниялар мұнай-химия зауытын салуға қатысады ма""). Imstalcon JSC participated in the manufacture of equipment for the project, while the Kazakh Institute of Oil and Gas JSC participated in the design of the complex (see ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex Construction Update""). Chicago Bridge & Iron Company (CB&I) received the PMC contract for project management (see ""History of the company""). The project was transferred from Samruk-Kazyna to the trust management of JSC NC KazMunayGas (KMG) in June 2018 (see ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex Construction Update"").

Upon completion, the petrochemical complex was expected to produce 500,000 tons of polypropylene per year and be the first integrated gas-chemical complex in Kazakhstan (see ""White & Case Advises Kazakhstan Petrochemical Industries...""). The plant was expected to go online in 2020 (see ""中国国家开发银行与哈萨克斯坦石油化学工业公司签署阿特劳天然气化工项目第一阶段建设融资协议""). On November 27, 2017, KPI sent a notice of the start of construction work to the general contractor (see ""Technopark phase""). The message was received and work began on December 11, 2017 (see ""CB&I Gets Go-ahead for Kazakhstan Petchem Project""). In October 2020, the project was 77% complete and expected to be complete in 2021 (see ""Large petrochemical complex to be launched in western Kazakhstan in 2021"").

STAFF_NOTE: This project is sometimes referred to as ""Construction of the first integrated gas chemical complex in Atyrau oblast,"" ""Construction of an integrated gas chemical complex in the Atyrau region - the first phase (polypropylene), or ""Integrated Gas Chemical Complex (Phase I – polypropylene production).""

The complex is located in the National Industrial Petrochemical Technopark Special Economic Zone (see ""Technopark phase"").

The BCL received an official guarantee from the Government of Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Finance (see slide 161 of ""Brief Summary/Kesimpulan Singkat Working Group on Oil, Gas and Coal""). JSC NC “KazMunayGas” also provided a guarantee for the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.1 million USD (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on October 15, 2012, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by linked project ID#54798. The PBC's maturity date was October 15, 2025, and it carried an interest rate of 3% per annum. This loan agreement was amended on October 30, 2014; however, the terms of the revision are unknown. Nor is it clear if DBK on-lent the proceeds of the PBC loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the PBC loan was $179.5 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

The total cost of the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project was $1,679,892,000.52 USD. It was also financed by a $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01) from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, a $297,500,000 USD loan dated August 8, 2012 from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and three loans dated July 27, 2012, November 13, 2012, and December 29, 2012 that collectively amounted to ₸20,790,000 KZT from JSC KazMunayGaz - Refining and Marketing. The loans also covered commissions for arranging loans and insurance premiums (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The loans from Eximbank, JBIC (which may have involved the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.), and DBK were all guaranteed by JSC NC “KazMunayGas” (see pg.108-109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Sinopec subsidiary Sinopec Luoyang Engineering Co., Ltd. was involved in the implementation of the project (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙""). Atyrau Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Kazakhstan and in 2011 refined 100,000 bbl of crude oil every day (see ""Awarded Contract for Atyrau Refinery Modernization Project Phase 3 in Kazakhstan"").

The project sought to increase the productivity of Atyrau Refinery to 5.5 million tons per year and oil refining efficiency to 87%, gaining the yield of motor fuel up to 77%, corresponding to the international standards of Euro-4 and Euro-5 (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP""). The project included the construction of 12 individual process units, a main facility with a catalytic cracking unit, designed for the conversion by delayed coking of the atmospheric distillation residues, heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil and heavy gas oil into liquified petroleum gas, gasoline, and light cracking gas oil. The complex was set to include LPG desulfurization facilities, oligomerization, a naphtha hydro-treating unit, a gasoline and gas oil catalytic cracking unit, hydrogen production, isomerization units, etc. (see ""Atyrau refinery LLP (AR)"").

The project's groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 10, 2012 (see ""哈萨克斯坦2012年石油工业发展简况""). It was expected that the implementation period would be 41 months (41 months from the groundbreaking ceremony is February 2016) and that construction would be completed in 2016 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The turnkey project was formally handed over to the project owner on May 30, 2019 (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙"""").

STAFF_NOTE: The average 6-month LIBOR in June 2012 was 0.736%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 0.736% + 4.1%, or 4.836%. The Chinese name of this project is 哈萨克斯坦阿特劳炼油厂石油项目. AidData suspects that the PBC captured by project ID#54798 partially financed DBK's earlier $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01); while the PBC came two months after this loan, DBK may have made that loan knowing that China Eximbank planned to contribute. If this is the case, it would explain how the project cost was reported as $1,679,892,000.52 USD despite the existence of this loan, which would have otherwise substantially increased the amount of financing. However, as stated earlier, it is unclear if this PBC was used to on-lend by DBK; this is merely informed speculation.

The $1.13 billion USD China Eximbank BCL to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project is separate from the $884 million USD China Eximbank loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project (see project ID#54066). It is very likely that the KazMunayGas Atyrau Oil Refinery Construction Project was funded through the $3.5 billion USD restricted portion of a China Eximbank Master Loan Facility (MLF) to the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, as captured in project ID#54797.

This oil refining complex was located in Atyrau.

54066,"China Eximbank provides a $884 million USD loan for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery via the restricted portion of a master loan facility with Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (Linked to Project ID#54797)","On August 1, 2009, the Export-Import Bank of China entered into a master facility agreement with the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK). China Eximbank permitted DBK to draw down up to $5 billion USD from a master facility agreement (MFA), which included an unrestricted $1.5 billion USD tranche and a restricted $3.5 billion USD tranche. The agreement was for a period of up to 15 years and it prohibited DBK from incurring indebtedness exceeding 25% of its assets or disposing of over 25% of its assets, in addition to a change of control clause favoring China Eximbank. The restricted portion of the MFA was for projects with a Chinese component, whereas the unrestricted portion was for DBK’s general purposes. The restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA was aimed at the development of energy, transport and communication infrastructure and the funding of strategic projects in the metallurgy, chemical, and oil industries. The proceeds from this credit facility were also be used for investment projects of Kazakhstan companies, including the exporting of industrial output, services and equipment to China (see pg.57-58 of ""DBK 2010 Base Prospectus"").

Under the restricted portion of the China Eximbank MFA (as captured by linked project ID#54797), DBK entered into a $884 million USD individual credit agreement with China Eximbank on December 12, 2009. The maturity date of this individual credit agreement was July 21, 2023. Principal and interest under the agreement was to be paid semi-annually (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

DBK then used these loan proceeds to on-lend to Atyrau Refinery LLP (a project company and special purpose vehicle responsible for the financing, design, and construction of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project at the Atyrau Refinery) as part of a larger $1.63 billion USD loan agreement. This loan agreement with Atyrau Refinery LLP, which is a subsidiary of KazMunayGas, was divided into a $691.4 million USD tranche with an interest rate rate an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR plus a 4.5% margin, a $40.4 million USD tranche with an interest rate of 7.72% per annum (payable in KZT), and a ₸58.536 million KZT tranche with an interest rate of 10.99% per annum (payable in KZT). DBK also offered a ₸26.401 million KZT credit line for the project, while Atyrau Refinery LLP contributed $66.63 million USD (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP"").

The purpose of the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project was to construct an aromatic hydrocarbons complex at the Atyrau Refinery capable of producing benzol and paraxylene. It also sought to increase the plant's balanced capacity to 5 million tons per year and produce motor fuels that meet K3 environmental requirements. Sinopec Engineering was the EPC contractor responsible for project implementation. JSC OGCC KazStroyService served as its subcontractor, while KazMunayGas was also a participant (see pg.16-17 of ""Annual report of “KazMunayGas – Refinery and Marketing” Joint-Stock Company for 2014""). Construction was set to begin in January 2010 (see ""Kazakhstan industry: China's Sinopec to finance hydrocarbons plant""). However, the construction of the complex began in October 2010 (see ""Implementation of the project...""). It was completed on December 25, 2014 (see ""The ceremony of the beginning of commissioning at a complex for production of aromatic hydrocarbons"").

STAFF_NOTE: The DBK credit agreement with China Eximbank was revised three times (on December 19, 2013, May 8, 2014 and October 30, 2014); however, the terms of these revisions are unknown (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017""). Also,China Eximbank provided a separate $1,130,408,642 USD buyer’s credit loan in 2012 to Atyrau Refinery LLP for a Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Project at the Atyrau Refinery (see project ID#39556).

This aromatic hydrocarbons complex is located in Atyrau.

54798,"China Eximbank provides a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit for the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project (Linked to Project ID#39556 and #54797))","On December 29, 2011, Atyrau Refinery LLP  — a project company and subsidiary of Kazakh state-owned KazMunayGas — signed an EPC turnkey contract for the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project (also known as the Advanced Oil Refining Complex Construction Project and the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project) with a consortium of contractors consisting of Sinopec Engineering Group (SEG), Marubeni Corporation, and JSC OGCC KazStroyService. SEG was the leader of the consortium; Marubeni Corporation participated in the logistics and procurement, as well as organizing financing from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, while JSC OGCC KazStroyService participated in construction and local procurement under SEG's leadership (see ""Implementation of the project ""Construction of a deep oil refining complex"").

Then, on June 6, 2012, Atyrau Refinery LLP entered into a $1,130,408,642 USD buyer’s credit loan (BCL) agreement (#BLA201201) with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by linked project ID#39556 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The BCL bears interest at a rate of six-month LIBOR plus 4.1% per annum and matures on November 6, 2025 (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus""). Sinosure provided $1.7 billion USD of buyer’s credit insurance (covering the loan loan principal and interest). The BCL received an official guarantee from the Government of Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Finance (see slide 161 of ""Brief Summary/Kesimpulan Singkat Working Group on Oil, Gas and Coal""). JSC NC “KazMunayGas” also provided a guarantee for the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.1 million USD (see pg.109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on October 15, 2012, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $199.5 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the Construction of Advanced Oil Refining Center at the Atyrau Refinery, as captured by this project. The loan's maturity date was October 15, 2025, and it carried an interest rate of 3% per annum. This loan agreement was amended on October 30, 2014; however, the terms of the revision are unknown. Nor is it clear if DBK on-lent the proceeds of the PBC loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP. As of June 30, 2017, the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the PBC loan was $179.5 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"").

The total cost of the KazMunayGas Atyrau Refinery Project was $1,679,892,000.52 USD. It was also financed by a $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01) from the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, a $297,500,000 USD loan dated August 8, 2012 from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC), and three loans dated July 27, 2012, November 13, 2012, and December 29, 2012 that collectively amounted to ₸20,790,000 KZT from JSC KazMunayGaz - Refining and Marketing. The loans also covered commissions for arranging loans and insurance premiums (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The loans from Eximbank, JBIC (which may have involved the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd.), and DBK were all guaranteed by JSC NC “KazMunayGas” (see pg.108-109 of ""2018 Base Prospectus"").

Sinopec subsidiary Sinopec Luoyang Engineering Co., Ltd. was involved in the implementation of the project (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙""). Atyrau Refinery is one of the largest refineries in Kazakhstan and in 2011 refined 100,000 bbl of crude oil every day (see ""Awarded Contract for Atyrau Refinery Modernization Project Phase 3 in Kazakhstan""). 

The project sought to increase the productivity of Atyrau Refinery to 5.5 million tons per year and oil refining efficiency to 87%, gaining the yield of motor fuel up to 77%, corresponding to the international standards of Euro-4 and Euro-5 (see ""Information on Atyrau Refinery LLP""). The project included the construction of 12 individual process units, a main facility with a catalytic cracking unit, designed for the conversion by delayed coking of the atmospheric distillation residues, heavy gas oil, vacuum gas oil and heavy gas oil into liquified petroleum gas, gasoline, and light cracking gas oil. The complex was set to include LPG desulfurization facilities, oligomerization, a naphtha hydro-treating unit, a gasoline and gas oil catalytic cracking unit, hydrogen production, isomerization units, etc. (see ""Atyrau refinery LLP (AR)"").

The project's groundbreaking ceremony was held on September 10, 2012 (see ""哈萨克斯坦2012年石油工业发展简况""). It was expected that the implementation period would be 41 months (41 months from the groundbreaking ceremony being February 2016) and that construction would be completed in 2016 (see ""Deep oil refining complex""). The turnkey project was formally handed over to the project owner on May 30, 2019 (see ""哈国阿特劳石油深加工项目“交钥匙"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of this project is 哈萨克斯坦阿特劳炼油厂石油项目. AidData suspects that the PBC captured by this project partially financed DBK's earlier $251,983,878 USD loan dated on August 17, 2012 (№DBZI 241-E / 05-01); while the PBC came two months after this loan, DBK may have made that loan knowing China Eximbank planned to contribute. If this is the case, it would explain how the project cost was reported as $1,679,892,000.52 USD despite the existence of this loan, which would have otherwise substantially increased the amount of financing. However, as stated earlier, it is unclear if this PBC was used to on-lend by DBK; this is merely AidData's informed speculation.

The $1.13 billion USD China Eximbank BCL to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Deeper Oil Conversion Complex Construction Project is separate from the $884 million USD China Eximbank loan to Atyrau Refinery LLP for the Aromatic Hydrocarbons Complex Construction Project (see project ID#54066). It is very likely that the KazMunayGas Atyrau Oil Refinery Construction Project was funded through the $3 billion USD restricted portion of a China Eximbank Master Loan Facility (MLF) to the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC, as captured in project ID#54797.

The oil refining complex was located in Atyrau.

73384,"Bank of China provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #40362)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline  was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years).  The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). This project captures the BOC contribution; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

This 1,454 km pipeline runs through the Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions.

73384,"Bank of China provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #40362)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline  was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years).  The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”).

54478,"Bank of China Kazakhstan contributes $120 million USD to loan syndicate for Shalkiya Zinc and Lead Mine Expansion Project","On December 29, 2017, JSC AB Bank of China Kazakhstan, a subsidiary bank of Bank of China (Beijing), and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) signed a $295 million USD syndicated loan contract with ShalkiyaZinc Ltd. JSC - a 100% subsidiary of Kazakh state-owned JSC Tau-Ken Samruk, National Mining Company of Kazakhstan - to partially finance the Shalkiya Zinc and Lead Mine Expansion Project. The EBRD was the lead arranger of the loan syndicate; Bank of China Kazakhstan provided $120 million USD and EBRD provided $175 million USD respectively. (see ""Bank of China to participate in EBRD Shalkiya Zinc syndicated loan""). Under the terms of this syndicated loan agreement, the principal debt was to be repaid in equal installments every six months beginning on June 20, 2021. The loan must be fully repaid as of December 20, 2029. Therefore, the loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 12 years and a grace period of 3.5 years, in addition to an interest rate of LIBOR plus a 2.5 % annual interest margin. National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided an irrevocable guarantee for the loan. The commission and reservation fees, paid by ShalkiyaZink Ltd. to EBRD in 2017, totaled ₸1,153,624 thousand KZT (see pg.167 of ""Annual Report 2017"").

The Zinc Mine Reconstruction and Expansion Project sought to expand the mining operations at the existing Shalkiya lead-zinc mine and construct a beneficiation plant at
the facility. Shalkiya lead-zinc deposit was one of the largest in Kazakhstan and was expected to produce 4 million tons of ore per year. The project intended to to introduce the latest technologies in the field of extraction and production, including a vertical ore hoisting conveyor, to the project. A new concentrating mill, tailing dump, intrasite networks, ore-issuing complex and carrying out mining and capital works at the Shalkiya mine were all included (see pg.3 and 167 of ""Annual Report 2017""). After completion of the reconstruction and expansion of the mine, it was expected that ShalkiyaZink Ltd. JSC would become the top zinc mining company in Kazakhstan, and one of the world's top zinc mining companies, developing the local economy, offering employment, and inducing development in upstream and downstream industries in Kazakhstan. The Ministry of Energy of Kazakhstan was to provide infrastructure services for the smooth implementation of the project (see ""哈萨克中国银行向哈锌矿项目提供1.2亿美元贷款【哈通社中文网】""). The EPC contractor responsible for project implementation was German company Engineering Dobersek GmbH. In 2018, construction was scheduled to begin in 2020 (see ""SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND SAMRUK-KAZYNA SIGNS..."")

The Shalkiya Mine is located in the territory of the Zhanakorgan District of Kyzylorda Region in Kazakhstan. The Shalkiya mining site is rather flat with some decline to the west towards the Syr Darya River. Code fixes of the mine are 67 degrees 25 minutes of east longitude and 44 degrees 01 minutes of north latitude. The mine is 15 kilometers north-west from Zhanakorgan settlement. The regional center of Zhanakorgan is connected by roads and railways to the rest of Kazakhstan, through the city of Shymkent – with Uzbekistan and China and through Kyzylorda – with Russia (see pg.12 of ""ShalkiyaZinc N.V. Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 December 2009""). More detailed locational information can be found at https://www.ebrd.com/documents/environment/esia-48347-nts.pdf.

STAFF_NOTE: The LIBOR rate was assumed to be 6-month. The six-month LIBOR rate in December 2017 was 1.768%.

KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million USD of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605; in addition, $600 million USD was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank (see ""Atasu-Alashankou project""). Then, in August 2013, KCP entered into a $300 million facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) to refinance notes that it had issued in 2005 for the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. This loan facility bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.75% margin per annum. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $180 million USD (₸59.8 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as 6-month LIBOR in August 2013 (0.395%) + 3.75%, or 4.145%; the maturity and grace periods are unknown.

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan.

(Linked to Project ID#73437)","In 2015, National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC signed a $1.5 billion USD syndicated term loan facility to partially finance the purchase of 50% of the shares of KMG Kashagan B.V. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) was one of the mandated lead arrangers. The loan captured a maturity period of five years (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agree to extend loan term on KMG Kashagan B.V. project""). On October 16, 2015, Samruk-Kazyna purchased 50% of the shares in KMG Kashagan B.V. from Coöperatieve KazMunaiGaz U.A for $4.7 billion USD; thus, this project was co-financed (pg.62 ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). In June 2018, Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agreed to extend the the loan term to 2022 (thereby increasing the maturity period to seven years) and to reduce the interest rate (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and ICBC agree to extend loan term on KMG Kashagan B.V. project""). This initial loan is captured by this project.

In July 2018, Samruk-Kazyna repaid $900 million USD of the $1.5 billion USD syndicated loan early. The remaining $600 million USD was refinanced by a new syndicated loan coordinated by Japanese bank MUFG Bank, Ltd. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) participated in this syndicated loan alongside Mizuho Bank, Ltd., Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, JSC “Halyk Savings Bank of Kazakhstan”, and Citibank Kazakhstan. The maturity date of this loan was extended until the end of 2022 (for a maturity period of seven years) because of the postponement of the option agreement for the repurchase of shares of KMG Kashagan B.V. by KazMunayGas (see ""Samruk-Kazyna and KazMunayGaz repaid 2.5 billion U.S. loans ahead of schedule"").

73476,"China National Petroleum Corporation provides $95.08 million USD for the construction of the Kazakh National Academy of Choreography","On December 4, 2013, China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) signed a memorandum with the Kazakhstani Ministry of Education and Science for the establishment of the Kazakh National Academy of Choreography in Astana (see ""乐玉成大使出席哈萨克斯坦教育和科学部长与各国驻哈使节座谈会""). CNPC provided funds for the academy at the request of President of Kazakhstan Nursultan Nazarbayev as a gift for the 25th anniversary of Kazakhstan's independence (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school""). CNPC provided $95.08 million USD for the academy (pg.66 of ""2016 China National Petroleum Corporation Corporate Social Responsibility Report""). The construction of the academy had a total cost of $153 million USD; Kazakhstani-state owned National Welfare Fund Samruk-Kazyna JSC provided the remaining $58 million USD (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

Some of the funds provided by CNPC were used on the construction of the main stage of the Astana Ballet Theater, which included a 783-seat auditorium and a modern and innovative lighting system for performance. The academy consisted of a school building, an office building, a residential building, and the Astana Ballet Theater (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight""). The educational building had classrooms, a teachers’ room, an indoor garden, a cafeteria, a library, a sports hall, and other rooms. There were 21 rehearsal rooms. The residential building consisted  of dormitories and rent-free staff apartments (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school""). The academy had an area of 9.5 hectares (see ""Благотворительность"").

The academy was the first institution of higher education in Central Asia to have a full cycle of choreographic education (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography""). The academy was designated as a national institution of higher education. It had programs ranging from the basics of dance and ballet training to master’s and doctoral programs (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography Opens in Astana""). The academy taught classical ballet, traditional Kazakh dance, and modern dance. Once the students were enrolled, the Government of Kazakhstan would cover all expenses (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

Kazakhstani construction company Bazis-A was responsible for project implementation (see ""KAZAKH NATIONAL CHOREOGRAPHY ACADEMY BUILT AT EXPENSE OF EXTRA-BUDGETARY FUNDS""). Swedish company Gustafs Scandinavia AB and Russian firm Eurostroysoyuz provided materials and designs for the interior of the theatre (see ""Kazakh National Academy of Choreography""). Construction had begun by June 2014, and the school was expected to be open in April 2016 (see ""National Academy of Choreography to Open in 2016 in EXPO Complex""). President Nazarbayev opened the academy on August 31, 2016 (see ""Kazakhstan opens Central Asia's first graduate dance school"").

CNPC later donated ₸10 million KZT ($27,117 USD) in 2018 to help finance the academy's purchase medical rehabilitation facilities (see ""Oil major puts dance in spotlight"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of the academy is 哈萨克斯坦国家舞蹈学院. A Chinese project title (using an alternative version of the school name) is 阿斯塔纳兴建国立舞蹈学院的工作. The Chinese name of the agreement signed in December 2013 was《关于在阿斯塔纳建设民族舞蹈与芭蕾舞学院的备忘录》. There are many alternative names for the academy in English. They include the National Academy of Dance, the High School of Choreography, the Higher School of National Dance and Ballet, the Astana National Dance Academy, and the National Dance Academy of Kazakhstan.

This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan (see ""О внесении изменения в постановление Правительства..."").

China XinXing Construction Development Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation (see ""新兴集团承接的哈萨克斯坦两段公路改造项目贷款协议签约""). The project sought to construct the 33 km long southwest bypass of Astana, giving it an asphalt and concrete surface of category I (see pg.38 of ""Logistics and Transport Competitiveness in Kazakhstan""). Once completed, the road would allow freight vehicles to travel around the city, reducing urban traffic and enabling the development of of logistics centers and service facilities along the ring road. Construction began in December 2017 and the road was expected to be fully operational by 2019 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目""). The construction was suspended for a month due to the COVID-19 pandemic; it restarted in May 2020, with an expected handover dating now falling in August 2020 (see ""Feature: Ring road construction resumes as Kazakh capital partially reopens"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#55016), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

This project supported the construction of a 33 km southwest section of the ring road (bypass road) around the city of Astana -- from the road to the airport to the M36 highway.

KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million USD of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605; in addition, $600 million USD was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank (see ""Atasu-Alashankou project""). Then, in August 2013, KCP entered into a $300 million facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) to refinance notes that it had issued in 2005 for the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. This loan facility bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.75% margin per annum.

Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as 6-month LIBOR in August 2013 (0.395%) + 3.75%, or 4.145%; the maturity and grace periods are unknown.

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan.

This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The Government of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan (see ""О внесении изменения в постановление Правительства...""). 

The total project cost was approximately $297 million USD; co-financiers are unknown (see ""新兴集团承接的哈萨克斯坦两段公路改造项目贷款协议签约""). The reconstruction of the Merke-Burylbaytal highway was divided into 4 sections totaling 262 km in the Jambyl Region of Kazakhstan. The road section from Merke to Shu, 86 km long, was to be for four-lane traffic. The remaining 3 sections from the town of Shu to the village of Burybaytal,176 km long in total, was to be for two-lane traffic. The highway was to pass through the settlements of Tatti, Shu, and Birlik. The project included the construction of six bridges, three overpasses over rail lines, 11 illuminated traffic intersections, 276 culverts, recreation areas, and auto pavilions. The project was expected to be completed in June 2022 (see ""В Жамбылской области началась реализация...""). China XinXing Construction Development Co., Ltd. was the contractor responsible for project implementation. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on March 26, 2019 (see ""新兴建设承建的哈萨克斯坦MB266国家级公路改造项目举行开工典礼"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#55016), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

70646,"China Development Bank provides a $100 million USD loan to Chem-Plus LLP for the production of caustic soda in the Chemical Park Taraz Special Economic Zone","In June 2017, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $100 million loan agreement with Chem-Plus LLP to finance the production of caustic soda. The loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 10 years and an interest of 4.7% per annum (pg.27 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год""). The project had a total cost of ₸47.6 billion KZT (approximately $142.8 million USD in 2017); thus, this project was co-financed (see ""Айдын Рахимбаев возглавил ренкинг крупнейших получателей господряда в Казахстане"").

The project was located in Chemical Park Taraz Special Economic Zone in the Shu District of the Jambyl Region (see ""Astana hosts fourth meeting of Kazakhstan-China Business Council""). The project sought to construct a caustic soda line at the Formulation Complex, intended for the production and sale of plant protection products (herbicides) for the Kazakhstani market (see ""Actual projects - Chem-Plus LLP""). It was to be capable of producing 40,000 tons. The commissioning was planned for 2020. Construction had begun by 2017, but it had been suspended until a decision was made on the further implementation of the project's fourth start-up glyphosate complex (pg.34 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год"").

A consortium led by Kazakhstani company Construction Corporation Kulager LLP was awarded the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract for the project on November 20, 2017 (see pg.19 of ""Chem-plus LLP Financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 together with independent auditor's report""). In addition to Kulager LLP, the consortium featured German company Chemieanlagenbau Chemnitz GmbH, Kazakhstani company Promstroyproekt Design Institute LLP and Kazakhstani company Aral Service LLP (pg.8 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год""). The construction was on-going as of December 31, 2018 (see pg.16 of ""Chem-plus LLP Financial statements For the year ended 31 December 2018 together with independent auditor's report""). The complex was commissioned in January 2019, but it appears that the caustic soda line had not gone into production (see ""Actual projects - Chem-Plus LLP"").

The shareholders of Chem-Plus LLP were Kazakh state-owned enterprises: United Chemical Company LLP (99.87% ownership stake) and Samruk-Kaazyna Invest LLP (.13% ownership stake) (see pg.14 of ""ГОДОВОЙ ОТЧЕТ 2017 год"").

61056,"CDB provides $2.3 billion USD in debt facilities for the development of Bozshakol and Bozymchak copper deposits - Drawn Down Amount (Linked to Project ID#40241 and #61142)","In December 2009, KAZ Minerals PLC secured debt facilities worth $2.7 billion USD by a loan from China Development Bank (CDB) and JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna for the development of copper deposits Bozshakol, Bozymchak and other growth projects. The breakdown of these debt facilities was as follows: $2.1 billion USD signed on December 30, 2009 for Bozshakol, Bozymchak, and other development projects; $200 million USD signed on January 12, 2010 for Bozshakol, Bozymchak, and other development projects; two facilities of $200 million USD each for the Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects signed on June 11, 2012. KAZ Minerals and a subsidiary of Samruk-Kazyna, provided a guarantee for these obligations. The funds were fully drawn in January 2013. They attracted interest semi-annually at an annualized rate of USD LIBOR + a 4.80% margin. The loans under this credit line had a final maturity date falling between January 2022 and August 2025. The first repayment commenced in January 2013. The $400 million USD that had been allocated to Akbastau-Kosmurun and Zhomart projects was repaid early, in January 2014, because these projects were unlikely to proceed in the medium term (see pg.53 and 96 of ""RELEASE OF FINAL RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2014 AND RESUMPTION OF TRADING"").

For the remaining $2.3 billion USD, KAZ Minerals signed an amendment to the debt facilities with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna on December 29, 2014. The changes made by the amendment include the following: the facilities became bilateral between KAZ Minerals and CDB; the interest rate was lowered from USD LIBOR + a 4.80% margin to USD LIBOR + a 4.50% margin; and an arrangement fee of 0.5% was agreed to, of which 60% was paid in December 2014 and 40% was paid in January 2016. The loan’s maturity and grace period were left unchanged; KAZ Minerals PLC continued to guarantee this CDB facility (pg.135 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016"" and ""Amendment to CDB facilities""). The amount outstanding on the previous facility when the amendment was signed was $2.1 billion USD. As of December 31, 2016, $1.7 billion had been drawn down under the facility agreements. Arrangement fees with an amortised cost of $20 million USD were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39 (pg.135 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016"").

To calculate the interest rate at time of commitment, the 6-month LIBOR rate as of December 2009 was used (0.453%); total interest rate equals 0.453% + 4.8%, or 5.253%. The grace period was set to 3 years (as the loan was first contracted on December 30, 2009 and the first repayment began in January 2013), and the maturity period was set to 15.66 years (as the loan was contracted on December 30, 2009 and the final loan maturity date was in August 2025). The bilateral amendment between CDB and KAZ Minerals also clarified the loan proceeds were to be used “principally for the development of the Bozshakol and Bozymchak [mine] projects."" As of November 30, 2014, the principal balance outstanding on the facilities was $2.086 billion USD. This project records the transaction amount $2.3 billion USD, as it appears to have been fully drawn down (see ""Amendment to CDB facilities"").

Bozymchak is an open-pit copper mine and concentrator in Ala-Bukinsky region of the Jalal-Abad Region, Kyrgyzstan. China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was the EPC contractor for the Bozymchak mine project (see ""NFC In Central Asia""). The completion ceremony for the Bozymchak mine took place on August 5, 2015 (see ""Kazakhmys Gold opens new copper, gold and silver mine in Kyrgyzstan""). Detailed locational information about this mine can be found at https://www.mindat.org/loc-297492.html.

The Bozshakol mine is a large copper mine located in the North Kazakhstan Region. NFC was the EPC contractor for the Bozshakol mine project, with a contract valued at $486 million USD. The project sought to establish facilities able to mine 30 million tonnes per year. It was planned to be complete on June 30, 2015. (see ""NFC Signs Contract on Bozshakol Copper Concentrator Project with Kazakhmys""). The completion of construction and the commencement of commissioning works was held on September 29, 2016 (see ""Bozshakol Clay Plant Completion"").

61142,"[Refinancing] CDB debt facilities for development of Bozshakol and Bozymchak copper deposits (linked to #61056 and #40241)","In December 2009, KAZ Minerals secured debt facilities of $2.7 billion loan from China Development Bank and JSC Sovereign Wealth Fund Samruk-Kazyna for the development of copper deposits Bozshakol, Bozymchak and other growth projects. In January, $400 Million allocated to projects that were unlikely to proceed in the medium term was repaid early. For the remaining $2.3 billion debt, KAZ signed an amendment to the debt facilities with CDB and Samruk-Kazyna in December 2014. The changes made by the amendment include the following changes: the facilities will become bilateral between KAZ Minerals and the CDB, Interest rate lowered from USD LIBOR plus 4.80% to USD LIBOR plus 4.50%, Arrangement fee of 0.5%, 60% payable in December 2014 and 40% payable in January 2016. To calculate the interest rate at time of commitment, the 6 Month LIBOR Rate as of December 2009 is used - 0.453%. Total interest rate = 0.453% + 4.5% = 4.953%. As at 30 November 2014, the principal balance outstanding on the facilities was $2,086 million. This project captures the rescheduling of the debt in 2014.

53544,"China Development Bank provides a $400 million USD loan for the 630 MW Third Unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Plant Project (Linked to Project ID#66481)","On October 22, 2013, China Development Bank (CDB) and Russia's Vnesheconombank (VEB) signed a $400 million USD loan agreement to finance the construction of the Third Unit of the Ekibastuz GRES-2 Power Station in Kazakhstan (see ""Eighteenth regular meeting between the heads of the Russian and Chinese governments""). The loan had a maturity period of 10 years; its other terms are unknown. This loan was often lumped together with a $800 million USD CDB loan to VEB for a multifunctional complex in Moscow, signed at the same time (captured by linked project ID#66481), as a ""$1.2 billion USD loan"" (see pg.50 of ""VEB Annual Report 2013""). 

VEB used the proceeds of the CDB $400 million USD loan to on-lend to the ""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC) for the construction of the third unit of Ekibastuz GRES-2 coal power plant in Ekibastuz. Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу""). VEB led a consortium, that included the Eurasian Bank of Kazakhstan, were to provide a $700 million USD syndicated loan for the project (see ""DEWEY & LEBOEUF REPRESENTS EKIBASTUZ GRES-2 POWER STATION ON A $770 MILLION SECURED FINANCING""). The project had a total cost of $700 million USD (see ""China and Russia to spend $400 million on Kazakhstan power plant""). VEB's finances were drained because of its financing of Olympic facilities in Sochi, making it look to CDB to partially finance the project (see ""Taming the Dragon: How Can Russia Benefit From China’s Financial Ambitions in the SCO?"").

""Ekibastuz GRES-2"" Joint Stock Company (JSC), an energy company located in Kazakhstan, managed the plant. Until December 2019, Russian energy company Inter RAO UES owned 50% and Samruk-Energy (JSC) owned 50% of Ekibastuz GRES-2. In December 2919, Samruk-Kazyna JSC purchased the 50% Inter RAO's shares for $25 million USD, transferring the plant entirely to Kazakhstan through the management of Samruk-Energy (JSC). Ekibastuz GRES-2 was a coal-power thermal power plant with an installed capacity of 1 GW, located in the city of Ekibastuz in the north of Kazakhstan (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу"").

The two existing power units at GRES-2 currently produce about 12% of all electricity produced in Kazakhstan in 2010. The CDB-financed project involved the construction, development and operation of a third unit, which, once completed, would seek to increase the power station’s installed capacity by 50% (see ""DEWEY & LEBOEUF REPRESENTS EKIBASTUZ GRES-2 POWER STATION ON A $770 MILLION SECURED FINANCING""). The capacity of the third unit was expected to be 630 MW. Construction began on October 21, 2014. The project was planned to be completed in 2017 (see ""На Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 началось строительство 3-го энергоблока"").  Construction was apparently delayed in 2016, but it has since returned (see ""3-й энергоблок Экибастузской ГРЭС-2 и др. проекты. Самрук-Энерго озвучил планы на среднесрочную перспективу"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Russian project title is 3-го блока Экибастузской ГРЭС.

KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million USD of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605; in addition, $600 million USD was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank (see ""Atasu-Alashankou project""). Then, in August 2013, KCP entered into a $300 million facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) to refinance notes that it had issued in 2005 for the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. This loan facility bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.75% margin per annum. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $180 million USD (₸59.8 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as 6-month LIBOR in August 2013 (0.395%) + 3.75%, or 4.145%; the maturity and grace periods are unknown.

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan.

40267,"China Eximbank provides a $400 million USD loan for the Pavlodar Aluminium Smelter Construction Project","In May 2010, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK) entered into a $400 million USD loan agreement with the Export-Import Bank of China for the aluminium smelter construction project in Pavlodar. The loan accrued the following terms: a maturity period of 15 years (the maturity date was May 21, 2025) and an interest rate of 4%. The principal and interest were to be repaid semiannually. As of June 30, 2017, the principal amount outstanding under this loan was $324 million USD (see pg.67 of ""Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017"" and “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC”). Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC) provided a guarantee for the loan, which was reportedly a line of credit (see “Overview of key developments from analysts of Asyl Invest JSC (Kazakhstan) on April 16, 2010”).
 
DBK then used the proceeds of the China Eximbank loan to on-lend to Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter JSC (KAS) (also known as Kazakhstan Electrolytic Plant JSC), the project company and a subsidiary of ENRC and responsible for the Pavlodar Aluminium Smelter Construction Project. The entire project cost $1.0183 billion USD, and KAS contributed $618.3 million USD (see pg.67 of “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC” and ""Kazakhstan Aluminium Smelter JSC"").

The Pavlodar Aluminium Smelter project sought to construct a primary aluminum smelter in Pavlodar with a capacity of 250,000 tons per year (see “Information on Kazakhstan Electrolytic plant JSC”). In addition to financing the smelter, the loan was intended to pay for costs incurred during the first and second phases of the electrolysis plant (see “Overview of key developments from analysts of Asyl Invest JSC (Kazakhstan) on April 16, 2010”). China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was the EPC contractor. Construction began in 2014 (see “President of Kazakhstan Inspects CPC Plant Undertaken by NFC in Pavlodar”).

55016,"China Eximbank provides a $796 million USD preferential buyer’s credit loan for the Ceconstruction of the 763 km Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk Segment of the Almaty-Oskemen Road Project (Linked to Project ID#54989, #54990, and #54991)","In May 2016, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. signed a EPC agreement with KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAvtoZhol) for the reconstruction of the 763 km Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk segment of the 1003 km Almaty-Oskemen road project (see ""Kazakh Reconstruction Project of State-owned Highways"").

Then, in 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $796 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with JSC NC KazAvtoZhol for the Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk (763 km) Road Project (see loan value at ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""; see year at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""; see PBC at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目""). This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). On April 24, 2017, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan on behalf of KazAvtoZhol (see ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""). The loan legally entered into force in June 2017 (see ""Кредитное соглашение по реконструкции автодороги вступило в силу""). The total cost of the project was $936 million USD; co-financers are unknown (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

This project involved a reconstruction of a 763 km long segment of Kazakhstan's national highway network, stretching from Taldykorgan, capital of the Almaty Region, to Oskemen (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk), the administrative center of the East Kazakhstan Region (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project sought to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, allowing the speed limit to be up to 120 km/h. In addition to CITIC Construction, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy performed work on the project (see ""Reconstruction Works on Taldykorgan – Kalbatau – Ust-Kamenogorsk Road km 615-1073 in Eastern-Kazakhstan Oblast""). On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

This loan agreement with AKAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP carried the following terms: a maturity period of 8.5 years and an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + 4.50% (see ""KAZ Minerals: Credit line approval""). DBK additionally provided $600 million USD for the project, while KAZ Minerals added $963 million USD. The plant was expected to have a capacity of 25 million tons annually (see ""Information on KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP""). In 2014, China Nonferrous Metal Industry's Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was granted the contract to construct the sulphide concentrator (see ""Chinese Projects Bring New Opportunities to Aktogay in Kazakhstan""). The main sulphide concentrator was commissioned on December 6, 2016 (see ""NEW $300 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY WITH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF KAZAKHSTAN AND PXF UPDATE""). Production began in February 2017 (see ""Completion of Koksay Project Investment By NFC"").

STAFF_NOTE: Because the exact date of signing of the CDB-DBK deal was unknown, the average 6-month LIBOR for the year 2016 was used instead, 1.058%. Therefore, the interest rate was coded as 1.058% + 4.5%, or 5.558%. This loan is linked to two previous loans for the Aktogay Mine (Kazakh: Ақтоғай мыс кен орны), a large scale, open pit mine with an average copper grade of 0.36% (oxide) and 0.33% (sulphide). In 2011, CDB committed two loans (see Project ID#41941 and #39557) worth $1.5 billion USD: a $1.34 billion USD and an RMB 1 billion loan to develop the Aktogay mine for copper cathode production.

The Aktogay mine is located in south eastern Kazakhstan in East Kazakhstan Province approximately 250 km from the Kazakhstan-China border.

41941,"China Development Bank provides a $1.34 billion USD loan for the Aktogay Copper Mine Development Project (Linked to Project ID #39557 and #53580)","On June 13, 2011, Kazykhmys PLC (now called KAZ Minerals PLC) signed a memorandum of understanding with China Development Bank (CDB) for a $1.5 billion USD loan to develop its, Aktogay Copper Mine Project (see ""中方贷款给哈15亿美元开发铜矿""). On December 16, 2011, CDB signed two bilateral agreements with KAZ Minerals Aktogay LLP, a subsidiary of Kazykhmys, to set up loan facilities worth $1.5 billion USD for the mine (pg.105 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016""). 

Then, on February 16, 2012 the loan was finalized and signed as two tranches, to be available for draw down for three years: one for RMB 1 billion ($158 million USD), the other for $1.34 billion USD (see ""Kazakhmys announces $1.5 billion loan facility to fund Aktogay project""). The maturity period was 15 years from the date of first draw down and the grace period is 3 years for both loan tranches. The interest rate for the USD-denominated loan tranche (as captured by this project) is LIBOR + a 4.20% margin and the interest rate for the RMB tranche (captured by linked project ID#39557) was based on the applicable benchmark lending rate published by the People's Bank of China (PBoC). KAZ Minerals PLC provided a guarantee for these loans. As of December 31, 2015, the RMB facility was fully drawn down. To protect against currency risks, KAZ Minerals swapped the interest basis from a RMB interest rate into a USD LIBOR interest basis. As of December 31, 2016, the USD facility was fully drawn down. Arrangement fees with an amortized cost of $15 million, were netted off against these borrowings in accordance with IAS 39 (see pg.137 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016""). The USD facility was repayable in half-yearly installments beginning in March 2018 (see pg.45 of ""KAZ MINERALS PLC AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017"").

 The 2016 audited KAZ Minerals financial report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.12% and 4.33% (as of December 31, 2016) and 5.12% and 3.93% (as December 31, 2015), respectively (see pg.136 of ""From Promise to Performance - KAZ Minerals PLC Annual Report and Accounts 2016""). The 2017 report identified the interest rates of the USD-denominated and RMB-denominated loan tranches as 5.60% and 4.54% (as of December 31, 2017) respectively (see pg.45 of ""KAZ MINERALS PLC AUDITED RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017""). AidData has used this most recent information to code the interest rates of these projects.
The development cost of the copper mine was $2 billion USD, with KAZ Minerals seeking to fund the remaining $500 million USD. The mine was eventually expected to produce up to 100,000 tons of copper concentrate annually beginning in 2015 (see ""中方贷款给哈15亿美元开发铜矿""). The project was comprised of an open-pit mine and an on-site concentrator to produce copper cathode from oxide ore and copper concentrate from the sulphide ore, with molybdenum as a by-product. Alarko was the engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contractor responsible for the processing plant at Aktogay. BIR provided engineering and consultancy services for architectural, civil, mechanical and electrical works for the project. ABB provided complete electrification and automation solutions and three gearless mill drive systems, while Ausenco was contracted to work on the open-pit mine. China Nonferrous Metal Industry’s Foreign Engineering and Construction Co., Ltd. (NFC) was awarded the contract for the construction of the sulphide concentrator. Construction began in 2013 (see ""Aktogay Copper Mine""). Copper cathode production from oxide began on December 1, 2015 (see slide 16 of ""2015 Full Year Results""). CDB would later commit $300 million USD in 2016 specifically for the construction of the sulphide concentrator by NFC, as captured by linked project ID#53580.

Then, in 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $796 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with JSC NC KazAvtoZhol for the Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk (763 km) Road Project (see loan value at ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""; see year at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""; see PBC at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目""). This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). On April 24, 2017, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan on behalf of KazAvtoZhol (see ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""). The loan legally entered into force in June 2017 (see ""Кредитное соглашение по реконструкции автодороги вступило в силу""). The total cost of the project was $936 million USD; co-financers are unknown (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

This project involved a reconstruction of a 763 km long segment of Kazakhstan's national highway network, stretching from Taldykorgan, capital of the Almaty Region, to Oskemen (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk), the administrative center of the East Kazakhstan Region (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project sought to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, allowing the speed limit to be up to 120 km/h. In addition to CITIC Construction, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy performed work on the project (see ""Reconstruction Works on Taldykorgan – Kalbatau – Ust-Kamenogorsk Road km 615-1073 in Eastern-Kazakhstan Oblast""). On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

40162,"China Development Bank provides a $200 million USD loan for the 300 MW Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Project","In June 2006, at the Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit, China Development Bank (CDB) signed a $200 million USD export buyer's credit loan agreement with the Moynak Hydroelectric Power Station Joint Stock Company (JSC) for the 300 MW Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Plant Project (also known as the Moinak Hydro Power Plant or Мойнақ СЭС-і). (see ""中哈总理见证公司签约哈萨克斯坦建国以来最大水电站项目""; ""Experience""; and ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The Government of Kazakhstan established the Moynak Hydro-Electric Power Station JSC in 2005 to own and operate the hydroelectric plant (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The Government of Kazakhstan provided a guarantee for repayment of one half of the amount (see ""Kazakhstan’s Electric Power Sector: New Challenges and Opportunities""). The construction of the 300 MW hydroelectric plant had a total cost of $346.6 million USD. In addition to the $200 million CDB loan, the Development Bank of Kazakhstan JSC (DBK)  provided loans worth $118.6 million USD, while Moynak Hydro-Electric Power Station JSC contributed $28 million USD (see ""Information on Moynak HPP JSC"").

Construction on the plant had started in 1985 but then stopped in 1992 due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Thanks to the CDB financing, construction on the power plant started anew. The Moynak plant was designed to house two 150 MW turbines that could generate 1.27 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year. The project sought to end energy shortages in southern Kazakhstan with its reliable energy, enabling growth in the industrial sector of the region (see ""Analysis: Kazakhstan's hydroelectric potential attracts foreign investment"").

China International Water and Electric Corporation (CWE), China Geo-Engineering Corporation (CGC), and Chengdu Hydropower Investigation and Design Institute (CHIDI) jointly implemented the Moynak Hydropower Plant Construction Project (see ""中国公司在哈萨克斯坦承建的水电站引水隧洞贯通""). The project included the design, manufacturing, supply, installation, commissioning, training, and maintenance for the plant, with a quality assurance period for major equipment of 20 years (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理签署政府令""). The station was expected to be completed and put into operation in December 2009 (see ""公司获准承建哈萨克斯坦第一个自主开发水电站工程""). The launching ceremony of construction was held on August 8, 2008 (see ""陆国俊总经理出席玛依纳水电站工程启动仪式""). The Moynak hydropower plant was commissioned on December 9, 2011. In 2012, it generated 503,98 million kWh of electricity (see ""History of the company"").

STAFF_NOTE: The Chinese name of the power station is 联营体承建的哈萨克斯坦玛依纳水电站. Another alternative name in English is “Construction of Moynak HPP on Charyn river.” Moynak is also spelled ""Moinak.""

The power station was located in the village of Moynak near the town of Kegen, approximately 200 km from Almaty, along the Charyn (also spelled Sharyn) River in Almaty Region.

55016,"China Eximbank provides a $796 million USD preferential buyer’s credit loan for the Ceconstruction of the 763 km Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk Segment of the Almaty-Oskemen Road Project (Linked to Project ID#54989, #54990, and #54991)","In May 2016, CITIC Construction Co., Ltd. signed a EPC agreement with KazAvtoZhol National Company Joint Stock Company (JSC NC KazAvtoZhol) for the reconstruction of the 763 km Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk segment of the 1003 km Almaty-Oskemen road project (see ""Kazakh Reconstruction Project of State-owned Highways"").

Then, in 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $796 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with JSC NC KazAvtoZhol for the Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk (763 km) Road Project (see loan value at ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""; see year at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""; see PBC at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目""). This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). On April 24, 2017, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan on behalf of KazAvtoZhol (see ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""). The loan legally entered into force in June 2017 (see ""Кредитное соглашение по реконструкции автодороги вступило в силу""). The total cost of the project was $936 million USD; co-financers are unknown (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

This project involved a reconstruction of a 763 km long segment of Kazakhstan's national highway network, stretching from Taldykorgan, capital of the Almaty Region, to Oskemen (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk), the administrative center of the East Kazakhstan Region (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project sought to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, allowing the speed limit to be up to 120 km/h. In addition to CITIC Construction, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy performed work on the project (see ""Reconstruction Works on Taldykorgan – Kalbatau – Ust-Kamenogorsk Road km 615-1073 in Eastern-Kazakhstan Oblast""). On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

53673,"Chinese Government provides $17.2 million USD for the Chukurbulak Dam Construction Project on the Khorgos River","On June 8, 2017, during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping to Kazakhstan, the Chinese Government and the Government of Kazakhstan signed an agreement on the construction of the Chukurbulak («Шұқырбұлақ») dam on the Khorgos River (see ""Negotiations with Xi JInping, Chairman of the People's Republic of China, in expanded format""). The estimated cost of the project was $34.4 million USD (₸11.7 billion KZT) (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). The Chinese Government provided 50% of the financing for the project, or $17.2 million USD, while the Government of Kazakhstan provided the other 50% (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). China was set to own 50% of the dam after completion, while the other half would be property of Kazakhstan (see ""Kazakhstan, China to jointly build dam on Khorgos river""). The Parliament of Kazakhstan ratified the agreement on June 21, 2018 (see ""Kazakhstan's Parliament ratifies agreement with China on construction of dike"").

The mudflow dam was located on Khorgos River 5 kilometers upstream from the Kazakh-Chinese joint Dostyk Hydraulic Power System, in the small town of Dostyk in the Almaty Region on the border with China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. The dam was intended to protect the Khorgos International Center for Cross-Border Cooperation, the Dostyk Hydraulic Power System, the Baskunchi and Khorgos settlements, the Atasu-Alashankou oil pipeline, road and railway bridges, and the people living in the river's lower basin, from mudflows and floods. The Committee for Emergency Situations of Kazakh Ministry of Internal Affairs and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps were responsible for the dam. Experts from both countries performed cost estimates and created designs for the project. A Kazakh-China committee was to be established to manage the construction process, while the operation and management was to be determined by a later agreement (see ""Kazakhstan, China to construct dam on Khorgos River"").

The construction of the dam included a central reinforced concrete section (featuring the necessary metal structures), an earth part of the dam, a control and measuring system, and a temporary cofferdam and drainage channel for passing water during the construction period, as well as 200-meter shore protection structures (dams) under the dam (see ""Kazakhstan and China to construct dam on Khorgos River""). The dam was designed to intercept mudflows of up to 9.8 million cubic meters (see ""Kazakh-Chinese dam to protect ICBC Khorgos""). Part of the dam was located on Chinese territory (see ""ПОЗДРАВЛЯЕМ!""). Construction began on April 18, 2019 (see ""АЛМАТЫ ОБЛЫСЫНЫҢ ҚОРҒАС ӨЗЕНІНДЕ «ШҰҚЫРБҰЛАҚ»..."").

Then, in 2017, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $796 million preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with JSC NC KazAvtoZhol for the Taldykorgan-Ust-Kamenogorsk (763 km) Road Project (see loan value at ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""; see year at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""; see PBC at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目""). This loan carried the following terms: a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). On April 24, 2017, the Ministry of Finance of the Republic of Kazakhstan provided a sovereign guarantee for this loan on behalf of KazAvtoZhol (see ""Постановление Правительства 204 17.04.2017...""). The loan legally entered into force in June 2017 (see ""Кредитное соглашение по реконструкции автодороги вступило в силу""). The total cost of the project was $936 million USD; co-financers are unknown (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

This project involved a reconstruction of a 763 km long segment of Kazakhstan's national highway network, stretching from Taldykorgan, capital of the Almaty Region, to Oskemen (formerly Ust-Kamenogorsk), the administrative center of the East Kazakhstan Region (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project sought to widen the carriageway by up to 9 meters, allowing the speed limit to be up to 120 km/h. In addition to CITIC Construction, Todini Central Asia LLP and JSC K-Dorstroy performed work on the project (see ""Reconstruction Works on Taldykorgan – Kalbatau – Ust-Kamenogorsk Road km 615-1073 in Eastern-Kazakhstan Oblast""). On June 7, 2017, CITIC Construction accepted an order from the Government of Kazakhstan to commence work (see ""CITIC Construction Sign Multiple Cooperation Documents with Kazakhstan""). The contract period was 54 months. Construction began in November 2017. As of the end of 2018, the project was 8% complete (see pg.46 of ""CITIC Group Annual Report 2018""). The project was expected to be completed in May 2022 (see ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"").

In 2017, JSC NC KazAvtoZhol signed 4 preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreements with China Eximbank in 2017 worth $1,667,577,000 USD to support 4 road reconstruction projects: the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54990), the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project (captured by this project), the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project (captured by linked project ID#54989), and the Astana Bypass Road Reconstruction Project (see linked project ID#54991) (see that the loans were PBCs at ""哈萨克斯坦总理马明视察中国企业承建公路项目"": see rest at pg.14 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018""). The projects had the following contributions from Eximbank: $434.5 million USD for the Kalbatau–Maikapshagai Road Reconstruction Project, $796 million USD for the Taldy-Korgan-Kalbatau-Ust-Kamenogorsk Road Reconstruction Project, $253.3 million USD for the Merke-Burylbaital Highway Reconstruction Project, and $183.95 million USD for Astana Bypass Road. The sum of these 4 loans is $1,667,750,000 USD, which is very close to $1,667,577,000 USD figure provided by JSC NC KazAvtoZhol. All four of these loans carried a maturity period of 20 years and an interest rate of 2% (see pg.14 and 47 of ""Financial Statements for the year ended 31 December 2018"").

54527,"ICBC provides $300 million USD to refinance notes issued in 2005 for the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#39605 and #72865)","JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

To finance the 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, CNODC and KTO contributed $50 million USD of their own funds (as captured by linked project ID#39605; in addition, $600 million USD was raised through the issuing of Eurobonds by JP Morgan Bank (see ""Atasu-Alashankou project""). Then, in August 2013, KCP entered into a $300 million facility agreement with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (Almaty) JSC (ICBC Almaty) to refinance notes that it had issued in 2005 for the Atasu-Alashankou Section of Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project. This loan facility bears interest at a rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 3.75% margin per annum. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $180 million USD (₸59.8 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as 6-month LIBOR in August 2013 (0.395%) + 3.75%, or 4.145%; the maturity and grace periods are unknown.

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The original financing of the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605.

The 965 km Atasu-Alashankou pipeline runs from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China. It passes through the Karaganda, East-Kazakhstan and Almaty regions of Kazakhstan.

39562,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan for Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#40362 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company"").

It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

40362,"CDB provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent.

As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030.

54524,"ICBC participates in a $1.18 billion USD loan facility for the 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#39605 and #54523)","On August 12, 2008, Chinese-Kazakh joint venture Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP entered into a $1.18 billion USD credit facility with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and the ING Bank N.V. for a term of ten years, subject to extension for up to five additional years. This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing the construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion USD. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR + a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee from the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalised interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on the information above, the interest rate was recorded as 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, or 5.108%, while the maturity period is 10 years and the grace period is zero. 

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605, while the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline is captured by linked project ID#54523.

STAFF_NOTE: As the loan financiers include a non-Chinese financier (ING Bank N.V.) and the breakdown of loan amounts between the 2 financiers are not known, a transaction amount has not been recorded for this project. This project is sometimes called “Second stage of Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline construction.""

The 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline runs from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan and runs through three regions (Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda). A 483 km segment runs from the Kenkiyak station to the Aralsk area, and a 311 km segment to the Kumkol station.

39562,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan for Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#40362 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

54524,"ICBC participates in a $1.18 billion USD loan facility for the 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#39605 and #54523)","On August 12, 2008, Chinese-Kazakh joint venture Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP entered into a $1.18 billion USD credit facility with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and the ING Bank N.V. for a term of ten years, subject to extension for up to five additional years. This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing the construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion USD. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR + a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee from the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalised interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on the information above, the interest rate was recorded as 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, or 5.108%, while the maturity period is 10 years and the grace period is zero. 

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605, while the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline is captured by linked project ID#54523.

STAFF_NOTE: As the loan financiers include a non-Chinese financier (ING Bank N.V.) and the breakdown of loan amounts between the 2 financiers are not known, a transaction amount has not been recorded for this project. This project is sometimes called “Second stage of Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline construction.""

The 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline runs from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan and runs through three regions (Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda). A 483 km segment runs from the Kenkiyak station to the Aralsk area, and a 311 km segment to the Kumkol station.

39562,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan for Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#40362 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (captured by this project). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 (implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1.0 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each reportedly contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”). For the BOC contribution, see linked project ID#73384; for the CDB contribution, see linked project ID#40362.

STAFF_NOTE: The 3-month LIBOR rate in December 2012 was 0.309%. The interest rate, therefore, was coded as 0.309% + 2.7%, or 3.009%.

39997,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan for the Kazakhstani Section of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline (Linked to Project ID#40833, #39955, #54489, #54528, and #70616)","The Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, also known as the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline or, simply, the Asia Gas Pipeline, is a 1,873-km long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, delivering gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","Energy Generation and Supply","http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201406/20140600614564.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia2.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/i/jyjl/m/200912/20091206674970.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/headnews/201112/20111207886063.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201401/20140100473010.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NG_69.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0321_china_energy_downs.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/WP-18-05_PPPs%20for%20Cross-border%20Infrastructure%20Dev_MV_formatted.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://kase.kz/files/emitters/KZTG/kztgf9e1_2017.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://center.cnpc.com.cn/bk/system/2017/12/07/001671340.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://kase.kz/files/emitters/KMGZ/kmgzf4_2018_eng.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/o73wxg53o6oo07z/Experience.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0lany8wv8oxwxc/Flow%20of%20natural%20gas%20from%20Central%20Asia.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://ucd58b783786223ac6a136fa0f9b.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyppxwt8jkgjf4bm%2FChina%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Silk%2520Road%2520Economic%2520Belt%2520Initiative-%2520Network%2520and%2520Influence%2520Formation%2520in%2520Central%2520Asia%2520.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.gem.wiki/Central_Asia-China_Gas_Pipeline#Location_.28Lines_A.2CB.2CC.29","The source shows the path of the pipeline","good code up","province",68.51,43.2,"South Kazakhstan","Region","KAZ.12_1","Kazakhstan"
40174,"China Eximbank provides a $43.668 million USD loan to BTA Bank for the construction of South Kazakhstan cement plant","On October 31, 2008, the Export-Import Bank of China signed a $43.680 million USD preferential buyer’s credit (PBC) loan agreement with BTA Bank (Turan-Alem Bank) to finance construction of a cement plant in the South Kazakhstan Region (see ""BTA Bank (Kazakhstan) and Export-Import bank of China sign credit agreement...""). The loan carried a maturity period of six years and a ""substantial grace period."" It covered 80% of the cost of the project; the remainder was co-financed (see ""Cement project strengthens trade co-operation""). BTA Bank then used the proceeds of the PBC loan to on-lend to Standard Cement LLP, the company responsible for the cement plant (see ""BTA Bank (Kazakhstan) and Export-Import bank of China sign credit agreement..."").

The plant was to have a production capacity of the plant of 1 million tons of Portland cement per year. It was expected to meet the needs of southern Kazakhstan and export to other Central Asia countries (see ""Cement project strengthens trade co-operation""). The plant used dry process to create cement, an environmentally-friendly process (see ""Standard Cement Company history""). The project included the construction of a cement production line with a daily capacity of 2,500 tons. Tianjin Cement Industry Design & Research Institute Co., Ltd. — a unit of Sinoma International Engineering Co., Ltd. — won the contract from Standard Cement for the design and equipment for the cement production line (see ""China’s Sinoma unit wins US$55m Kazakhstan cement plant contract""). The project commenced on May 8, 2012. The project was handed over to Standard Cement on June 25, 2013. After the expiration of the defects notification period, all construction on the project was complete on August 25, 2014 (see ""FAC for Kazakhstan Slag Grinding Project of Standard Cement"").","Industry, Mining, Construction","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020110925e4b30094f&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://kase.kz/en/news/show/1059594/, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://web.archive.org/web/20150419221133/http://www.sinoma.com.cn/en/xinwenzixun/qiyedongtai/20140917/59448.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.cemnet.com/News/story/153181/bta-bank-to-finance-standard-cement-new-line.html, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://standard-cement.com/en/istoriya, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/1m80lqtkxyl6sxx/BTA%20Bank%20-%20News.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/jjocutpre4f64dw/Best%20Deals%20of%202008_%20Standard%20Cement%2C%20Kazakhstan%20_%201Global%20Trade%20Review%20%28GTR%29.pdf?dl=0, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/z6yyxsdtjef4ya4/BTA%20Bank%20%28Kazakhstan%29%20and%20Export-Import%20bank%20of%20China%20sign%20credit%20agreement%20of%20financing%20of%20construction%20of%20cement%20plant%20in%20South%20Kazakhstan%20-%20Kazakhstan%20Stock%20Exchange%20%28KASE%29.pdf?dl=0, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.cemnet.com/News/story/138713/china-s-sinoma-unit-wins-us-55m-kazakhstan-cement-plant-contract.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.cemnet.com/News/story/138713/china-s-sinoma-unit-wins-us-55m-kazakhstan-cement-plant-contract.html, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020110925e4b30094f&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","https://www.gtreview.com/news/asia/best-deals-of-2008-standard-cement-kazakhstan/","China financed the construction of a South Kazakhstan cement plant in 2008.

40362,"CDB provides $350 million USD via a $700 million USD syndicated loan for Phase II of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project (Additional Financing) (Linked to Project ID#39562 and #73384)","On January 18, 2011, a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) called Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP (BSGP) was established in Kazakhstan to oversee the financing, design, and implementation of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project. JSC KazTransGas (KTG) and China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (acting through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) each held a 50% ownership stake in BSGP (see JV formation date at “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”; see rest at pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline was a 1454 km long gas pipeline that running through the Mangistau, Aktyubinsk, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions. It has a pipe diameter of 1067 mm (see “Beineu-Bozoy-Shymkent gas pipeline is the largest pipeline project...” and pg.149 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The purpose of the project was to ensure stable gas demand in the southern Kazakhstan, reduce dependence on imported gas and ensure the energy security of Kazakhstan. Construction of the pipeline was split into two phases (see “PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES”).

The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved the construction of 1,143.2 km of pipeline from the Bozoi gas metering station in the Shalkar region of Aktobe Region to Akbulak gas metering station in Sairam of South Kazakhstan Region (now known as the Turkistan Region). It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-1 and Bozoy shift camp in Shalkar region of Aktobe Region, emergency-response centers in Saksaulsk, Aksuat and Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region and an emergency-response center in Shornak within the South Kazakhstan Region, as well as construction of the automated process control system (SCADA) and telecommunication (fiber-optic communication line) for the gas pipeline in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). The first phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project was initiated on July 17, 2012 (see pg.29 of ""JSC NC ""KazMunayGas"" Annual Report 2013""). The project was expected to be completed by the end of 2012 (see ""China and Kazakhstan begin construction of the second stage of the gas pipeline""). It was completed on September 7, 2013, resulting in a throughput capacity of up to 10 bcm per year (see ""First section of China-Kazakstan gas pipeline II starts operation"").

The second phase of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project involved 306.3 km of gas pipeline construction from Beineu settlement in the Mangystau Region to Bozoi settlement in the Aktobe Region. It also involved the installation of pipeline facilities, such as: compressor station CS-4 Karaozek in the Kyzylorda Region, Beineu gas metering station in Mangystau Region, the SCADA central dispatch control in Kyzylorda, and gas pipeline construction in Mangystau, Aktobe, Kyzylorda and South Kazakhstan regions (see ""About the company""). It was completed on December 30, 2016 (see ""PROJECTS OF EXPORT GAS PIPELINES"").

Between 2014 and 2017, over 9.0 bcm of gas was transported via the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent gas pipeline, providing the southern regions with Kazakhstani gas. Then, in November 2017, a head compressor station at Bozoi and a line compressor station at Karaozek were put into operation, increasing the capacity of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline to 10 bcm per year. In October 2017, Kazakhstan began exporting gas to China pursuant to a contract concluded between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina for the supply of bcm from October 15, 2017 until October 14, 2018. The price of the gas exported to China pursuant to this agreement was linked to the price of Brent crude oil and determined quarterly. As of December 31, 2017, negotiations were ongoing with respect to a long-term gas supply agreement between JSC KazTransGas and PetroChina. BSGP and KazMunayGas expected that the export of gas to China would increase in the future and made plans to construct three new compressor stations on the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline between 2018 and 2019 to handle this (see pg.151-152 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In order to fund Phase I of the Beineu-Bozoi-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Project, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $1.8 billion USD syndicated loan with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) on December 11, 2012 (see linked project ID#39562). This loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.7% margin per annum for the duration of the guarantee period (until December 31, 2019) and, thereafter, at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 3.2% margin per annum. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in December 2017 until March 11, 2028 implying a grace period of 5 years and a maturity period of 15.25 years). The loan was secured by corporate guarantees from KazMunayGas and CNPC. Unspecified amendments to the facility were made in February 2016 (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus"" and pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

In February 2016 and September 2017, amendments were signed because of BSGP's non-compliance with certain project milestones provided for in the facility agreement; the milestones were extended until September 30, 2019. These amendments required BSGP's prepayment of $400 million USD of the outstanding indebtedness, which KazMunayGas provided to BSGP for repayment. The loan was secured by additional security, including an offshore account charge, an onshore account pledge and security assignment of BSGP's rights under the shareholder support agreement in favor of the security agent. As of June 30, 2017, the outstanding indebtedness under the loan was $1.462 billion USD (see pg.85 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus""). As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this loan was $1 billion USD (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

Then, on September 17, 2015, Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline LLP signed a $700 million USD syndicated loan with CDB and BOC for Phase II of the project to supplement their $1.8 billion USD loan. CDB and BOC each contributed $350 million USD. This loan reportedly carries a maturity period of 15 years; the maturity date was September 17, 2030. The interest rate of the loan is unknown (see “Beineu-Shymkent Gas Pipeline Phase2 Additional Financing”).

54524,"ICBC participates in a $1.18 billion USD loan facility for the 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol Section of the Kazakhstan-China Oil Pipeline Project (Linked to Project ID#39605 and #54523)","On August 12, 2008, Chinese-Kazakh joint venture Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP entered into a $1.18 billion USD credit facility with the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Limited (ICBC) and the ING Bank N.V. for a term of ten years, subject to extension for up to five additional years. This credit facility was entered into for the purpose of financing the construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. KCP had the right to draw down the loan in four tranches. It drew down three in 2008 in an aggregate principal amount of $1 billion USD. The availability period of this credit facility expired at the end of 2011. The borrowed funds bore an interest rate of 6-month LIBOR + a 2% margin per annum until February 2013 and 6-month LIBOR + a 4% margin per annum thereafter. CNPC provided a guarantee from the loan. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount under this facility was $403.9 million USD (including the capitalised interest) (₸134.3 billion KZT) (see pg.110 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). Based on the information above, the interest rate was recorded as 6-Month LIBOR in August 2008 (3.108%) + 2%, or 5.108%, while the maturity period is 10 years and the grace period is zero. 

JSC KazTransOil (KTO) and China National Oil and Gas Exploration and Development Corporation (CNODC) formed a joint venture Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) called Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP (KCP) on July 6, 2004 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline LLP History""). KCP was created to construct and operate the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline and the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline. These pipelines are two of three pipeline systems of the Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network, which was built to create a transport corridor for the export of Kazakhstani oil to China. KTO and CNODC each owned 50% of the joint venture (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). 

This project sought to the construct the Kenkiyak–Kumkol pipeline, which was intended to transport oil from West Kazakhstan and Aktobe oilfields. It began in Kenkiyak and ended in Kumkol. The pipeline was 794.263 km long and it had a maximum capacity of10 million tons a year. It included relay pump stations to increase the volume of oil transported (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline About""). The pipe had diameters ranging between 0.5 and 1.8 meters (see pg.37 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline passed through the Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda regions, with its oil destined for the Chinese market. JSC OGCC KazStroyService was responsible for the construction of the 483 km section from Kenkiyak to Aralsk, while China Petroleum Pipeline Engineering Co., Ltd. (CPPE) was responsible for the construction of a 311 km section to Kumkol. Construction of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline began on December 11, 2007 (see ""Kenkiyak - Kumkol""). The pipeline went into operation on October 6, 2009 (see ""Kazakhstan-China Pipeline"").

As of 31 December 31, 2017, the pipeline had a throughput capacity of 9.2 million tonnes of crude oil per year. In 2017, 5.2 million tonnes of crude oil were transported through the pipeline. Pursuant to an agreement between the KTO and CNODC, the capacity of the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline was increased from 10.0 million tonnes of crude oil per year to 20.0 million tonnes in
2015 so as to take advantage of expected increased production at Tengiz Field and Kashagan Field. Ten companies supply oil to the pipeline, which KCP has continued to own (pg.158 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus"").

The Kazakhstan-China Pipeline network is comprised of three systems: (i) the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline, from Kenkiyak in western Kazakhstan to Atyrau on the Caspian Sea; (ii) the Atasu-Alashankou pipeline, from Atasu in eastern Kazakhstan to Alashankou in western China; and (iii) the Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline, from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan. All three systems are operational (pg.249 of ""JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus""). The Atasu-Alashankou pipeline project is captured by linked project ID#39605, while the Kenkiyak-Atyrau pipeline is captured by linked project ID#54523.

STAFF_NOTE: As the loan financiers include a non-Chinese financier (ING Bank N.V.) and the breakdown of loan amounts between the 2 financiers are not known, a transaction amount has not been recorded for this project. This project is sometimes called “Second stage of Kazakhstan-China oil pipeline construction.""

The 794 km Kenkiyak-Kumkol pipeline runs from Kenkiyak to Kumkol in south Kazakhstan and runs through three regions (Aktobe, Kyzylorda and Karaganda). A 483 km segment runs from the Kenkiyak station to the Aralsk area, and a 311 km segment to the Kumkol station.

39997,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan for the Kazakhstani Section of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline (Linked to Project ID#40833, #39955, #54489, #54528, and #70616)","The Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, also known as the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline or, simply, the Asia Gas Pipeline, is a 1,873-km long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, delivering gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","Energy Generation and Supply","http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201406/20140600614564.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia2.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/i/jyjl/m/200912/20091206674970.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/headnews/201112/20111207886063.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201401/20140100473010.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NG_69.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0321_china_energy_downs.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/WP-18-05_PPPs%20for%20Cross-border%20Infrastructure%20Dev_MV_formatted.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://kase.kz/files/emitters/KZTG/kztgf9e1_2017.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://center.cnpc.com.cn/bk/system/2017/12/07/001671340.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://kase.kz/files/emitters/KMGZ/kmgzf4_2018_eng.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/o73wxg53o6oo07z/Experience.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0lany8wv8oxwxc/Flow%20of%20natural%20gas%20from%20Central%20Asia.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://ucd58b783786223ac6a136fa0f9b.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyppxwt8jkgjf4bm%2FChina%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Silk%2520Road%2520Economic%2520Belt%2520Initiative-%2520Network%2520and%2520Influence%2520Formation%2520in%2520Central%2520Asia%2520.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","","good code up","province",72.2,44.29,"Zhambyl","Region","KAZ.14_1","Kazakhstan"

40299,"Chinese Government provides a grant for 1 MW solar power plant and 5 MW wind farm","In December 2009, the Chinese Government pledged that it would provide Kazakhstan with equipment for sample solar batteries and wind turbines (see ""Kazakhstan, China deepen energy cooperation""). On September 26, 2011, the Chinese Government signed an agreement on free technical assistance with the Government of Kazakhstan. China agreed to provide a grant of pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan for renewable energy projects (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan""). The equipment from the grant was to enable the construction of a 1 MW solar power plant (SES) and a 5 MW wind farm (WES) (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants"").

The 5 MW wind farm consisted of two wind power plants with a capacity of 2.5 MW each, with project electricity generation of 17 million kWh per year. The construction period was from March to November 2018 (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants""). The wind farms had 80-meter tall towers and a 53.8-meter long blades that could generate electricity at wind speeds of 3 m/s to 25 m/s. The 5MW wind power plant was to be built in the Yenbekshikazakhsky District of the Almaty Region over an area of 25 ha (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan"").

The 1 MW solar power station, located in the special economic zone “Park of Innovative Technologies” (or “IT Park”) in the Almaty Region, produced electricity by poly- and single-crystal photoelectric modules, with a projected electricity generation of 1.4 million kW/h per year. The construction period was from December 2017 to October 2018 (see ""China Helps Kazakhstan Build Solar and Wind Power Plants""). The solar plant featured 1,716 monocrystalline panels with a capacity of 285 W and 1,892 polycrystalline panels. The power generated from these plants was sold in the network of JSC “Almaty Power Plants” (see ""Solar and wind power plants were commissioned in Almaty and Almaty region"").

According to the agreement, the Chinese side was to deliver, assemble, and commission the equipment at its own expense, while Kazakhstan was to exempt the equipment from customs duties and taxes (see ""China to give away pilot samples of solar batteries and wind turbines to Kazakhstan""). The general contractor for the projects was CITIC Construction Group, and the operators of the wind and solar plants were “Samruk-Energy” JSC and Powerchina Zhongnan Engineering Corp. Ltd.

39997,"CDB and Bank of China provide a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan for the Kazakhstani Section of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline (Linked to Project ID#40833, #39955, #54489, #54528, and #70616)","The Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline, also known as the China-Central Asia Gas Pipeline or, simply, the Asia Gas Pipeline, is a 1,873-km long gas pipeline connecting Turkmenistan to China via Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, delivering gas equal to approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption. It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).
 
This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C, which is sometimes referred to as a part of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. The financing of the Uzbek section is captured by linked project ID#54528. The 1,830 km long pipeline begins at the Turkmen-Uzbek border and ends at Khorgas in Xinjiang. Construction of Line C began in September 2012. The overall welding work of the pipeline was completed at the end of 2013. Line C went into operation on May 31, 2014 (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). It began transferring gas to China in June 2014 (see ""Gas trade for the better""). Line C successfully transmitted gas to Khorgas on June 15, 2017 (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介""). Line C has a designed capacity of 25 billion cubic meters per annum, and its pipe diameter is 1,219 mm, 152 mm larger than Line A/B. Upon completion of all supporting facilities of Line C, the overall delivery capacity of the Central Asia-China Gas Pipeline was expected to reach 55 billion cubic meters per annum, equaling approximately 20% of China’s annual natural gas consumption while annually substituting 73 million tons of coal and cutting carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide emissions by 78 million tons and 1.21 million tons respectively. Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan contribute each 10 bcm of gas to Line C, while Kazakhstan supplies 5 bcm of gas (see ""Flow of natural gas from Central Asia""). 

In December 2012, AGP entered into a $4.7 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the construction of Line C of the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + a 2.35% margin per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + a 3.45% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in June 2017 until December 27, 2027. The loan was secured by a ""ship or pay"" transportation agreement pledge, account charges, insurance and reinsurance policies assignments, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $2.9 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.85 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, the interest rate was recorded as 3-Month LIBOR in December 2012 (0.309%) + 2.35%, or 2.659%, while the grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.","Energy Generation and Supply","http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201406/20140600614564.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://www.cnpc.com.cn/en/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia/FlowofnaturalgasfromCentralAsia2.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://www.mofcom.gov.cn/aarticle/i/jyjl/m/200912/20091206674970.html, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz2.mofcom.gov.cn/article/headnews/201112/20111207886063.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); http://uz.mofcom.gov.cn/article/jmxw/201401/20140100473010.shtml, Government Source (Donor/Recipient); https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.oxfordenergy.org/wpcms/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/NG_69.pdf, Other Official Source (non-Donor, non-Recipient); https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/0321_china_energy_downs.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/files/publications/WP-18-05_PPPs%20for%20Cross-border%20Infrastructure%20Dev_MV_formatted.pdf, Other Academic (Working Paper, Dissertation); https://kase.kz/files/emitters/KZTG/kztgf9e1_2017.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://center.cnpc.com.cn/bk/system/2017/12/07/001671340.shtml, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; http://kase.kz/files/emitters/KMGZ/kmgzf4_2018_eng.pdf, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://www.dropbox.com/s/o73wxg53o6oo07z/Experience.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://www.dropbox.com/s/g0lany8wv8oxwxc/Flow%20of%20natural%20gas%20from%20Central%20Asia.pdf?dl=0, Implementing/Intermediary Agency Source; https://ucd58b783786223ac6a136fa0f9b.previews.dropboxusercontent.com/nativeprint?file=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dropbox.com%2Fs%2Fyppxwt8jkgjf4bm%2FChina%25E2%2580%2599s%2520Silk%2520Road%2520Economic%2520Belt%2520Initiative-%2520Network%2520and%2520Influence%2520Formation%2520in%2520Central%2520Asia%2520.pdf%3Fdisable_range%3D1%26from_native_print%3D1%26preview%3D1, Government Source (Donor/Recipient)","https://global.factiva.com/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZOIL0020110517e75300001&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks; https://global-factiva-com.proxy.wm.edu/redir/default.aspx?P=sa&an=KAZAEN0020150526eb5q0000a&cat=a&ep=ASE, Media Report, including Wikileaks","","","good code up","province",77.96,44.96,"Almaty","Region","KAZ.1_1","Kazakhstan"

It consists of 4 lines (A/B/C/D). A, B, and C run parallel to each other. The pipelines begin at Gedaim on the Turkmen-Uzbek border, run through central Uzbekistan and southern Kazakhstan, and end at Khorgas in China's Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region. Line A (#40833 and #54489) of this pipeline became operational in 2009 while the other two lines — Line B (ID#40834 and #54489) and Line C (ID#39997) — started their operations in 2010 and 2014, respectively. Line A and B will be connected to the Second West-East Gas Pipeline, while Line C will be connected to the Third West-East Gas Pipeline. Line D (ID#39955 and #70616), which is under construction, will run through Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Kyrgyzstan to Wuqia County in China, where it will be connected to the Fifth West-East Gas Pipeline. Line A, B, and C provide 55 billion cubic meters of gas to China per annum (see ""中国-中亚天然气管道简介"").

JSC KazTransGas formed a joint venture (special purpose vehicle) with China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) (through Trans-Asia Gas Pipeline Company Limited) called Asia Gas Pipeline LLP (AGP) to construct and operate the Turkmenistan-China Gas Pipeline in Kazakhstan. JSC KazTransGas and CNPC each held a 50% equity stake in AGP (see pg.37 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus”).

This project records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Lines A and B, which are sometimes referred to as parts of the Kazakhstan-China Gas Pipeline. Project ID#39997 records the financing of the Kazakhstani segment of Line C. Line A and Line B begin on right bank of the Amu Darya River, near Turkmen-Uzbek border, before passing through central Uzbekistan and south Kazakhstan (see “中国-中亚天然气管道简介”). Construction of the Kazakhstani section of the pipeline commenced on July 9, 2008. As of October 20, 2012, all compressor stations along Line A and Line B of the Central Asia–China Gas Pipeline were operational, enabling the pipeline to transmit 30 billion cubic meters of natural gas annually (see “Flow of natural gas from Central Asia”).

In October 2008, AGP entered into a $7.5 billion USD syndicated loan facility with China Development Bank (CDB) and Bank of China (BOC) to finance the development, construction, and operation of lines A and B of the pipeline. The loan facility bore interest at a rate of 3-month LIBOR + 2.15% per annum during the guarantee period and 3-month LIBOR + 2.9% per annum thereafter. The loan was to be repaid in several installments beginning in March 2013 until October 22, 2023. The amounts due under this loan were secured by account charges, a pledge over deposit certificate agreement, an insurance assignment, and a guarantee from CNPC. As of December 31, 2017, the outstanding principal amount from this loan was $4 billion USD (see pg.110 and 151 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2018 Base Prospectus” and pg.84 of “JSC NC “KazMunayGas” 2017 Base Prospectus”). Based on this information, interest rate was recorded as the 3-month LIBOR in October 2008, 4.059%, + 2.15%, or 6.209%, while grace period was 4.5 years, the repayment period was 10.5 years, and the maturity period was 15 years.

The loan covered approximately 86% of the $200 million USD cost of the locomotives. The loan carried a maturity period of 14 years, a grace period of 4 years, and an interest rate of 5.6% (see ""State monopoly Kazakhstan railway will enrich locomotive depot due to credit""). This loan did not receive a sovereign guarantee from the Government of Kazakhstan (see ""KAZAKH RAILROAD TO GET $172 MLN FROM CHINA'S EXPORT-IMPORT BANK"").

Prior to this project, Kazakhstan Temir Zholy had not renewed its locomotive depot for eight years (see ""State monopoly Kazakhstan railway will enrich locomotive depot due to credit""). The China Northern Locomotive & Rolling Stock Industry Corporation provided the locomotives: two Dong Feng diesel locos with General Electric traction packages were to be imported from China, while another 150 were to be assembled in Shu in the Jambyl Region by 2009 (see ""Realities and costs drive Kazakhstan's railway reform"").

The credit line was intended to finance projects in the sectors of energy, transport, infrastructure, manufacturing, information technologies, agriculture, and other sectors. The credit line also aimed to finance joint Kazakh-Chinese and other projects (see pg.107 of 'BoP and External Debts 2016'). The maturity date of each loan made under this loan agreement was June 15, 2025 (see pg.67 of 'Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017'). In June 2015, DBK drew down $200 million USD for unspecified purposes, as captured by linked project ID#53573 (see pg.47 of 'Annual Report 2015'). In 2016, DBK drew down $170 million USD for unspecified purposes, as captured by linked project ID#53572 (see pg.65 and 67 of 'Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017'). As of December 31, 2016, DBK had drawn down $370 million USD (see pg.F-100 of 'Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017'). Then, between December 31, 2016 and June 30, 2017, DBK drew down an additional $80 million USD, as captured by this project. The credit line was left with $200 million USD remaining. The loan details and purpose of this $80 million USD tranche is unclear (see pg.67 of 'Development Bank of Kazakhstan Base Prospectus 2017'). STAFF_NOTE: AidData created this project to capture the drawn down amount not accounted for specific loans, not the entire credit line, which is captured by project ID#53574. There was $200 million USD remaining in the credit line that had not been drawn down as of June 30, 2017; therefore, $450 million USD had been drawn down. The $370 million USD is accounted for in linked projects ID#53573 and #53572; this project captures the $80 million USD that was drawn down but has not been connected to a specific project. Additionally, because the $370 million USD had been drawn down as of December 31, 2016 and $450 million USD had been drawn down as of June 30, 2017, the $80 million USD captured by this project must have been drawn down between those dates in 2017, hence the commitment year.
