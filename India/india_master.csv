The UMPP involves the construction and operation of a 3,960 MW coal-fired power plant and a captive coal mine in the village of Singrauli and the state of Madhya Pradesh. The proceeds from the syndicated loan were to be primarily used to purchase power equipment from Shanghai Electric (see Project ID #43107). 

The UMPP, which was officially commissioned on March 30, 2015, has 6 power towers of 660MW each and is a 'super-critical technology-based pit-head coal-fired power generating plant.' This project is linked to an earlier MOU captured in Project ID#43106. 

The 3,960MW Coal-Fired Sasan Ultra Mega Power Project (UMPP) is located in the village of Singrauli within the state of Madhya Pradesh.

STAFF_NOTE: On August 7, 2007, R-Power formally acquired Sasan Power Limited, a special purpose vehicle that was formed to implement the UMPP. R-Power, formerly Reliance Energy Generation Limited (REGL) is a part of the Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group. The company is the sole distributor of electricity to consumers in the suburbs of Mumbai. but in 2017 R-Power sold its Mumbai operation to Adani Power. R-Power also runs power generation, transmission and distribution businesses in other parts of Maharashtra, Goa and Andhra Pradesh. With its subsidiaries, it is developing 13 medium and large-sized power projects with a combined planned installed capacity of 33,480 MW. The Chinese name for this project is 印度莎圣项目.
